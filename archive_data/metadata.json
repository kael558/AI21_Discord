However, we\u2019d like to make sure the text adheres to our needs as developers. In many use cases, we\u2019d like to feed the model with some input text and get an output text that satisfies the product need. To do so, you need to engineer the perfect prompt.\nTo be more concrete, imagine you're building a writing platform that helps your users to write easier in their own voice. One of the main features is paraphrasing: given a sentence, your app should automatically suggest paraphrases of the same sentence that are more fluent and customized to the writer's voice (BTW, if you do happen to build this kind of app and need such a feature - head on over to our\nParaphrase API\n).\nYou\u2019d like to use AI21 Studio language models to automatically generate the paraphrased suggestions. You can think of the models as smart autocompletion machinery: you feed in text, and the model will generate text that seems like a natural continuation. Your job is to make sure that the desired output (paraphrases, in this example) are the most natural continuation. In other words, you need to create the perfect input to the model, also known as a prompt. So, what are your tools to make that happen?\nThis is the simplest approach. Simply format your input prompt into a template that screams out what the completion should be:\nZero-shot prompt\n[INPUT_TEXT]\n\nRewrite the sentence above:\nLet's put a sentence (by Oscar Wilde) into the template and see what we get:\nBe yourself; everyone else is already taken.\n\nRewrite the sentence above:\nFeeding this text into the model, you\u2019ll get a nice completion:\nBe yourself; you are the only one who can live your life.\nMake sure the text and the output are distinguishable. Did you notice the empty line between \u201c[INPUT_TEXT]\u201d and \u201cRewrite the sentence above:\u201d? \ud83d\ude09 So did the model. This will make it easier for the model to understand what to do.\nSometimes you'll be able to get better results if you specify the task twice - both at the beginning and at the end. In our case, you could use this template:\nHere's a sentence, followed by a paraphrase of it:\n[INPUT_TEXT]\n\nA paraphrase of the sentence:\nLook again at the output we got earlier. Maybe the new sentence isn\u2019t exactly what you imagined, and you want a different one. This can be challenging to specify in the prompt.. or maybe it\u2019s easy, but the model doesn't exactly meet your requirements. Suppose your user requires a formal tone. Simply adjusting the instruction to reflect this may not be enough, and the definition of formal may vary.\nA powerful solution would be to use the few-shot approach. Here, you\u2019ll need to gather a few examples of <input text, output text> pairs that adhere to your product needs. You should format the pairs into a template such that the desired output would be the most natural continuation. In our case, a suitable template would look like this (assuming you have two example pairs):\n[INPUT_TEXT_1]\n\nRewrite the sentence above to sound more formal:\n[OUTPUT_TEXT_1]\n\n###\n\n[INPUT_TEXT_2]\n\nRewrite the sentence above to sound more formal:\n[OUTPUT_TEXT_2]\n\n###\n\n[INPUT_TEXT_3]\n\nRewrite the sentence above to sound more formal:\nTo be more concrete, let's get examples of <input text, output text> that look like what we want, and format it into the template. Notice that we also add the input text provided by the user, but without a matching output text. We\u2019ll get this text that we\u2019ll feed into the model:\nYou only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.\n\nRewrite the sentence above to sound more formal:\nOne life is all you get, but if you live it properly, you can live it for a lifetime.\n\n###\n\nIf you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.\n\nRewrite the sentence above to sound more formal:\nIt is not necessary to remember anything if you tell the truth.\n\n###\n\nBe yourself; everyone else is already taken.\n\nRewrite the sentence above to sound more formal:\nAnd here\u2019s the generated result:\nDo not pretend to be someone else; be yourself.\nSeems that the model has captured the tone from the examples we provided. You can\ntry it yourself\nin the playground.\nAnother advantage of the few-shot approach is that we can tell the model when to stop. Did you notice the ### at the end of every rewrite? Besides being a separator between the examples, which helps the model to distinguish between them, it also helps us in knowing when the model should stop generating more text. You can read more about stop sequences\nhere\nMake sure the example inputs you gather are diverse. In the case of paraphrasing, if all the inputs are from the same domain (let\u2019s say tech), the model might be worse when given an input text from a different domain, such as medical.\nWhen using AI21 Studio for a classification task, make sure the outputs are balanced. For example, if instead of generating a paraphrase, you\u2019d like to predict a topic out of 5 possible topics, make sure all topics appear in the examples you provide, in a similar frequency.\nMoreover, make sure they\u2019re shuffled: if all the preceding examples have the same topic, the model will be more likely to predict that topic, even if it\u2019s not the right one.\nWant to dive deeper to prompt engineering?

Those huge models are based on the Transformers architecture, which allows for the training of much larger and more powerful language models.\nWe divide LLMs into two main categories: Autoregressive and Masked LMs (language models). On this page, we will focus on Autoregressive LLMs, as our language models, the Jurassic-1 series, belong to this category.\nAutoregressive LLM is a neural network model composed from billions of parameters. It was trained on a massive amount of texts with one goal: to predict the next word, based on the given text. By repeating this action several times, every time adding the prediction word to the provided text, you will end up with a complete text (e.g., full sentences, paragraphs, articles, books, and more). In terms of terminology, the textual output (the complete text) is called a \u201ccompletion\u201d, while the input (the given, original text) is called a \u201cprompt\u201d.\nImagine you had to read all of Shakespeare's works repeatedly to learn a language. Eventually, you would be able to not only memorize all of his plays and poems, but also imitate his writing style.\nIn similar fashion, we trained the LLMs by supplying them with many textual sources. This has enabled them to gain an in-depth understanding of English, as well as general knowledge.\nThe LLMs are queried using natural language, also known as\nprompt engineering\n.\nRather than writing lines of code and loading a model, you write a natural language prompt and pass it to the model as the input. For example:\nData, computation, and engineering resources are required for training and deploying large language models. LLMs, such as our Jurassic-1 models, play an important role here, providing access to this type of technology to academic researchers and developers.\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\u26a1 The task: predict the next word\n\ud83c\udf93 Added value: knowledge acquisition\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Interacting with Large Language Models\n\u2699\ufe0f Resource-intensive", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models"}, {"title": "When Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nGetting Started\nOverview\nQuickstart\nKey Concepts\nLarge Language Models\nTokenizer & Tokenization\nSampling From Language Models\nPrompt Engineering\nAdvanced\nSpecial Tokens and Whitespaces\nRepetition Penalties\nLogit Bias\nFoundation Models\nJurassic-2 Models\nInstruct Models\nCustom Models\nJurassic-1 Models [Legacy]\nTask-Specific APIs\nTask-Specific APIs Overview\nParaphrase API\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nText Improvements API\nSummarize API\nText Segmentation API\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nHow To...\nBuild a Dataset\nDatasets: Best Practices\nGenerating More Data Using AI21 Studio\nTips: Building a Dataset\nTrain a Custom Model\nTips: Training a Custom Model\nQuery your Custom Model\nWorking with amazon sagemaker\nPython SDK - with Amazon SageMaker\nChoosing the Right Instance Type\nUsage\nResponsible Use\nSafety Research\nWhen Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?\nWhen will a language model stop generating texts? Let's find out!\nMentioned here: stop sequence, max tokens, min tokens\nLanguage models were trained to generate text token by token and produce text completion in a scope that fits the prompt. Just like it learned how to generate text, it is also trained to know when to stop. Jurassic-1 tokenizers have a special token that signals when a reasonable generation should end by default. During pre-training, models were trained on text items containing stop sequence suffixes, and by doing so, they were adjusted to end sequences appropriately. However, there are times when the user will benefit from controlling the scope of the generated text, so how can you control the length of the sequence the models generate?\nYou can set a lower and upper bound for the amount of tokens the model will generate (\nminTokens\nand\nmaxTokens\n, respectively). Note that this is very artificial and may cause texts to be cut off in the middle of a sentence.\nYou can set a stop sequence that tells the model to stop generating text. When the model generates this sequence, we can  make it stop generating more text afterwards. A simple example: in order to generate a single sentence, you can set the character \".\" as a stop sequence, which will signal the model to stop once it is generated.\nThis is very handy when using a few-shot prompt: where we feed the model with a prompt containing a few examples. A few-shot prompt contains one or more completion examples preceding the actual text to complete. Upon generating the completion, the model may repeat the few-shot structures and generate additional examples unless otherwise instructed. Therefore, it is recommended to separate the examples with a custom sequence, such as \u201c==\u201d, and set it as a stop sequence. Once the text is generated, the model repeats the pattern and generates the separator, which indicates that text generation has been completed.

Each of those pieces is translated into its own vector representation, which is eventually fed into the model. For example:\nEach model has its own dictionary of tokens, which determines the language it \"speaks\". Each text in the input will be decomposed into these tokens, and every text generated by the model will be composed of them.\nBut how do we break down a language? Which pieces are we choosing as our tokens? There are several approaches to solving this:\nAs a simple solution, each character can be treated as its own token. By doing so, we can represent the entire English language with just 26 characters (okay, double it for capital letters and add some punctuation). This would give us a small token dictionary, thereby reducing the width we need for those vectors and saving us some valuable memory. However, those tokens don\u2019t have any inherent meaning - we all know what the meaning of \u201cCat\u201d is, but what is the meaning of \u201cC\u201d? The key to understanding language is context. Although it is clear to us readers that a \"Cat\" and a \"Cradle\" have different meanings, for a language model with this tokenizer, the \"C\" is the same.\nAnother approach we can try is breaking our text into words, just like in the example above (\"I want to break free\").\nNow, every token has a meaning that the model can learn and use. We are gaining meaning, but that requires a much larger dictionary. Also, it raises another question: what about words stemming from the same root word, like \u201chelped\u201d, \u201chelping\u201d, and \u201chelpful\u201d? In this approach, each of these words will get a different token with no inherent relation between them, whereas for us readers, it's clear that they all have a similar meaning.\nFurthermore, words may have fundamentally different meanings when strung together. For instance, my run-down car isn't running anywhere. What if we went a step further?\nIn this approach, we break our text into sentences. This will capture meaningful phrases! However, this would result in an absurdly large dictionary, with some tokens being so rare that we would require an enormous amount of data to teach the model the meaning of each token.\nEach method has pros and cons, and like any real-life problem, the best solution involves a number of compromises. AI21 Studio uses a large token dictionary (250K), which contains some elements from every method: separate characters, words, word parts, such as prefixes and suffixes, and many multi-word tokens.\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\ud83d\udd21 Character-level tokenization\n\ud83c\udd92 Word-level tokenization\n\ud83d\udcac Sentence-level tokenization\n\ud83c\udfc5 Which is best?", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization"}, {"title": "Recipes", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/recipes"}, {"title": "Quickstart", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nGetting Started\nOverview\nKey Concepts\nLarge Language Models\nTokenizer & Tokenization\nWhen Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?\nSampling From Language Models\nPrompt Engineering\nAdvanced\nSpecial Tokens and Whitespaces\nRepetition Penalties\nLogit Bias\nFoundation Models\nJurassic-2 Models\nInstruct Models\nCustom Models\nJurassic-1 Models [Legacy]\nTask-Specific APIs\nTask-Specific APIs Overview\nParaphrase API\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nText Improvements API\nSummarize API\nText Segmentation API\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nHow To...\nBuild a Dataset\nDatasets: Best Practices\nGenerating More Data Using AI21 Studio\nTips: Building a Dataset\nTrain a Custom Model\nTips: Training a Custom Model\nQuery your Custom Model\nWorking with amazon sagemaker\nPython SDK - with Amazon SageMaker\nChoosing the Right Instance Type\nUsage\nResponsible Use\nSafety Research\nQuickstart\nUsing AI21 Studio, you can solve challenging text understanding and generation tasks. Its straightforward API and interactive playground allows you to get started in minutes, without any prior knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\nBelow is a quickstart guide to cover all the basics you need in order to start building your solution. After that, you should feel comfortable using our large language models to start and solve your own use-case.\nA language model takes some text as input and produces a likely continuation. You can think of it as an exceptional student that can follow instructions and imitate examples.\nHere are two words you should know:\nPrompt\n- the input you provide to the model.\nCompletion\n- the output text the model returns.\nYou slept in and missed a crucial phone call? Here's how AI21 Studio can help you out of a bind: let's build an excuse generator.\nThe most naive thing to do is simply provide the model a prompt which is a simple instruction. This is what it looks like:\nZero-shot\n, because we are giving the model zero examples. Occasionally this may work, but you may receive various types of completions. The structure and tone of the completion may differ from your expectation, for example a short excuse when expected something elaborated.\nIf you want to get the most benefit out of large language models, it is recommended to insert a prompt that includes several examples (similarly to teaching a student).\nThe previous excuse was too generic and could have been used for anything.\nBy providing the model with examples\n, just as a human would, it could produce completions that are more aligned with your intentions. In order to help the model distinguish between each example, we use a stop sequence. The stop sequence itself should be immediately recognizeable when you look at the text as a whole. In this example, the stop sequence is\n##\nThis is called\nFew-shot\n, because we are inserting a prompt which includes a few examples.\nThe previous results were rather serious and not the most original. If you\u2019re looking for some more creative excuses,\nit should be reflected in your examples\n:\nSurely this will work on even the most skeptical boss.\nAnother way to affect the completion is to adjust some of the model parameters. A useful parameter is the temperature.\nYou can increase creativity by tweaking the temperature\n. With temperature 0, the model will always choose the most probable completion, so it will always be the same. Increasing the temperature will provide variable completions, where the completion may be different for every generation:\nA task that requires accurate results (such as classification) is best performed with low temperature, whereas a task that requires more creativity should be conducted with high temperature (0.7 is a reasonable starting point).\nWant to explore the various excuses the model can think of?\nTry it yourself!\nWe encourage you to play with our models in the AI21 Studio.

In here: Temperature, TopP, TopK\nA language model knows how to complete texts\ntoken\nby token. But how does it choose the next token? Will it always choose the same token for a given sequence, or will it choose something different every time?\nGiven a prompt (the input to the model), the model generates a distribution over all possible completions (output from the model). It does that by calculating the probability of every token in the dictionary appearing next. Then, the model samples a completion according to the distribution.\nLet's understand this by using a simple example. Suppose the prompt is the phrase \"I will\". Here is the distribution over all possible tokens (assuming a very small dictionary just for the demonstration):\nThere is a 55% chance that the model will choose the completion \"survive\", a 25% chance of the completion \"always love you\", etc. In simple words, it means that if we give the model this prompt 100 times, we'll likely get \u201csurvive\u201d 55 times, \"always love you\" 25 times, etc.\nAs users, we want to have some control over the output, so we can get the most out of it. The key is to somehow change the distribution the model samples without changing anything in the model. Here are three ways to adjust the sampling of language models using sampling parameters. Each of them has its own benefits, and it is also possible to combine them. In the end, it all comes down to what you need.\nThe most popular sampling parameter to play with is the temperature. Inspired by thermodynamics, low temperature means stagnation and high temperature means movement. The temperature value affects the distribution: for a low temperature, we get a higher weight for the most probable token. At 0 temperature, we always get the maximum token, and the distribution looks like this:\nNamely, the model will always sample the same token at every call.\nA high temperature does the exact opposite: the distribution tends to be as uniform as possible, meaning all tokens have about the same probability. It will look something like this:\nSo if you care about consistency and you always want to get the most likely completion (for example, in classification tasks), go for temperature=0. If you want more creativity (usually useful in text generation tasks), try a higher temperature (we recommend to start with 0.7).\nAnother sampling parameter that helps with adjusting the model\u2019s sampling is TopK. It\u2019s pretty simple: instead of using the full distribution, the model only samples from the K most probable tokens. For K=1, we basically get the same situation as temperature=0. In our example, for K=2, the distribution looks like this:\nThe third parameter is TopP. This is similar to TopK, but instead of limiting the number of tokens, we limit the total cumulative probability from which to sample. It works like this: we take the most likely token, add it to the pool, and add its probability to the amount. We continue adding tokens this way until the sum of probabilities reaches TopP.\nWhat happens here is effectively similar to TopK: we remove the \"tail\" of the tokens with the lowest probabilities, except that TopP is more flexible for the number of tokens. In our example for TopP=0.95, we sample from the following distribution:\nIf you want accuracy rather than creativity, go for temperature 0. This is useful in tasks of classification (Classification) or when extracting interesting details from texts (Extraction).\nIf you deal with text generation tasks (whether short texts like tweets or long ones like whole posts) or getting ideas for slogans, for example, you probably need creativity. It is strongly recommended to raise the temp. Is the model getting a little too wacky? Keep the temperature high, but reduce the TopP/TopK and prepare to be amazed.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\ud83c\udf21\ufe0f Temperature\n\ud83d\udcca TopK\n\ud83d\udcf6 TopP\n\ud83d\udd28 What can I do with this information?", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models"}, {"title": "AI21 Careers", "text": "Company\nAbout\nAsk RBG\nStart building\nAI21 Careers\nAI21 is bringing AI into the 21st century, developing AI systems with an unprecedented capacity to understand and generate natural language.\nOur products\nSee open positions\nPRODUCTs\nWordtune\nWordtune Read\nAI21 Studio\nRESOURCES\nBlog\nTalks\nPress\nCOMPANY\nAbout Us\nCareers\nNews\nContact Us\nEmail Us\ninfo@ai21.com\nAll Rights Reserved \u00a9 AI21 Labs, 2023\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy", "link": "https://www.ai21.com/careers"}, {"title": "How Verb created a game-changing author tool with AI21 Studio", "text": "Company\nAbout\nAsk RBG\nStart building\nDiscover how Verb.ai used AI21 Studio to create a revolutionary writing tool for authors, improving brainstorming and expression. Read the case study now.\nAccording to a\nNew York Times article\n, 81 percent of Americans feel they have a book in them that they should write. Now, it may be an old statistic, but mankind\u2019s desire to share stories\nhas been around since the dawn of time\nas a way to share empathy, connection, and entertainment. So, it surely isn\u2019t leaving human nature anytime soon.\nBut at the risk of stating the obvious: writing a book is hard. In fact, the writer of the aforementioned article, an author of 14 books, says \u201cwithout attempting to overdo the drama of the difficulty of writing \u2026 composing a book is almost always to feel oneself in a state of confusion, doubt and mental imprisonment.\u201d\nYeah, it\u2019s a lot of hard work.\nSo how did AI21 Studio help Verb, an AI-enhanced tool for fiction writers, create a cutting-edge application designed to help writers and hobbyists alike complete their novels without all the hassle and uncertainty?\nWe spoke to Ryan Bowman, publishing and creative writing veteran and part of Verb\u2019s small team of founders, to find out how AI21 Studio was a key to such creative writing success.\nForging the Way toward a New Creative AI Tool\nVerb\nis a writing tool that helps make completing long-form narratives \u2013 novels for now but later films, TV shows, even video games \u2013 faster, easier, and more fun. It does so by assisting with all key stages of creation: brainstorming, writing, and editing. But all that wasn\u2019t plausible until they found the perfect Language Learning Model (LLM). Let\u2019s dive in further.\nUse Case #1: Brainstorming Plot Points\nAs we saw in the New York Times quote above, keeping an entire story straight inside your head can be a lot of work. As anyone who\u2019s tried to write long-form\nanything\nknows, it can get messy, convoluted, jumbled, and sometimes, uninspiring.\n\u201cThey say novel writing is a group activity done by yourself,\u201d Ryan tells us. \u201cSo one of Verb\u2019s jobs is to be that other person, that brainstorm partner.\u201d That\u2019s why they set out to create one of their most important \u2013 and as it soon turned out, most popular \u2013 functions inside of their app: brainstorming. This feature allows you to plan the novel scene by scene, chapter by chapter.\nThat type of brainstorming could look like the following:\nYou write: \u201cBen is sitting in his office and a woman appears next door.\u201d\nYou click: \u201cSuggest a plot point\u201d\nAI generates: \u201cThe woman pulls out a gun and chases him through the hallway.\u201d\nThen, you can either:\nRun with that idea in your scene and use it as the next plot point, or\nContinue clicking the \u201cWhat happens next\u201d button to generate more ideas until you find one that sparks your imagination and helps you continue.\nAn incredibly useful tool for writers, it\u2019s been something that keeps these authors coming back for more. \u201cOne of the most amazing findings we\u2019ve seen,\u201d adds Ryan, \u201cis that the more you use what makes Verb special - AI features like plot planning, the more likely you are to come back and write.\u201d\nUse Case #2: Writing Literary Language\nGenerative AI models are incredibly diverse, and capable of outputting new content, summaries, translations, answers to questions, and more. But one thing they haven\u2019t been able to do just yet is write literary works. That\u2019s to say, these AI models can create \u2013 but they\u2019re not necessarily creative.\n\u201cWe needed to build tools that are specific to the problems of a novelist. It couldn\u2019t be just about generating text,\u201d Ryan explains, noting that Verb knew the AI model they were to use must be able to generate discursive literary language.\n\u201cLanguage Learning Models (LLM) are not natural storytellers,\u201d says Ryan, going on to explain how much storytelling is a learned craft; something that must be practiced for years in order to call it a skill. \u201cThere is 2,000 years of literary and practical theory backing up the idea that telling stories is hard \u2013 important and necessary but difficult.\u201d\nLuckily, Ryan and the team at Verb found the literary solution they needed in AI21 Studio. \u201cWhen generating texts for our users who are looking for more discursive, more literary, more discriminating language, AI21 turned out to have a good tone and feel,\u201d he says.\nUse Case #3: Fine-Tuning, Iterations & Customer Support\nOne of the critical tasks of validating generative models is having criteria. To validate the reliability of this sort of generative AI effectively, you still need human involvement \u2013 especially when creating something brand new to the market.\nHow\u2019d Verb achieve this? Verb built a platform that tests generative output amongst thousands of judgments across multiple writing professionals. These individuals look at different paragraphs of literary texts and decide which ones they like better, which ultimately helps Verb build a gradient of quality.\n\u201cWe keep trying and testing and building iterations on top,\u201d says Ryan, noting that they are always adding options to see which ones humans prefer. \u201cAs crazy as it sounds, we are in the process of teaching it literary theory.\u201d\nAlong the same lines, it\u2019s important to note that creating something so new to the market doesn\u2019t just call for multiple iterations but also gathers support from everyone involved.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a world of newness,\u201d Ryan laments. \u201cThere is nothing like [Verb] so we\u2019re not always sure what we\u2019re supposed to be doing \u2013 it is freeing and slightly frightening at the same time.\u201d\nRyan and the team at Verb knew they needed a company that could see in their vision \u2013 which is when they turned to AI21 Studio. \u201cWe found working with AI21 to be a breath of fresh air,\u201d says Ryan, noting that it felt like a collaboration done with real human faces they can interact with for guidance, assistance, and ideas \u2013 rather than a business-client relationship.\nThe Results: More Authors Finishing their Novels, Faster\nThe\nself-publishing landscape of 2022\nshows that indie writers are becoming the new norm. But\nAI has been an alleged threat to writers\nsince its inception, leading many people to believe that writers wouldn\u2019t even want the help of an AI-enhanced tool to get them across the finish line.\nSo, of course, Verb also has to ask themselves the question: Are writers really interested in having a machine collaborator help them with their creative writing? \u201cOur early data says that they are,\u201d says Ryan, noting that since launching its alpha version using AI21 Studio, Verb has seen a dramatic uptake of this experimental tool.\nNot to mention, as we saw with the brainstorming feature, the more creative and collaborative the model, the more likely writers are to stick around the app.\nIn fact, Ryan confirms that there are a dozen or so authors (out of an intimate group of alpha users) who have done the hardest task \u2013 actually finishing their book! \u2013 stating that Verb helped them do just that.\nWith Verb, and the help of AI21 Studio, it can be done. Dare we say \u2013 it can be done faster, easier, and with more fun.\nVerb.ai & Creative Texts in the Future\nVerb launched its beta version in late December 2022 to a select number of users, and plans to use this custom model to expand into other narrative forms such as screenwriting and TV & Film.\nWith the pairing of new tools such as Verb with custom models from AI21 Studio, generative AI has evolved from just helping individuals generate text to something much more intertwined with the human love of storytelling; an AI tool that is not a threat to writers but actually a collaborator, a copy editor, a creative director, and even a confidante for inspired wordsmiths around the world.\nAre you interested in building your own custom model with AI21 Studio by your side?

We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

This request should include the input text prompt as well as any relevant parameters for controlling the text generation. Additionally, you must include\nyour API key\nin the request headers for authentication purposes.\nOnce you've sent your\ncomplete\nrequest, you'll receive a response that includes the tokenized prompt, as well as the generated text completion(s). This generated text is referred to as\n, and can include multiple outputs depending on the parameters you set. The response may also contain additional metadata relevant to the generation process.\nJurassic-2 models come in three variations -\nLarge\n,\nGrande\nand\nJumbo\n.\nLarge:\nDesigned for fast responses, this model can be fine-tuned to optimize performance for relatively simple tasks.\nGrande:\nThis model offers enhanced text generation capabilities, making it well-suited to language tasks with a greater degree of complexity.\nJumbo:\nAs the largest and most powerful model in the Jurassic series, J2-Jumbo is an ideal choice for the most complex language processing tasks and generative text applications.\nEach of these parameters can be used to customize the behavior of the Jurassic-2 language models, allowing developers to fine-tune the model's responses to better suit their needs:\n: The initial prompt to generate responses from.\n: The number of responses to generate for a given prompt.\nmaxTokens\n: The maximum number of tokens to generate for each response.\nminTokens\n: The minimum number of tokens to generate for each response.\ntemperature\n: A value controlling the \"creativity\" of the model's responses.\ntopP\n: A value controlling the diversity of the model's responses.\nstopSequences\n: A list of sequences that, when generated, will cause the model to stop generating tokens.\n: The number of top-scoring tokens to consider for each generation step.\nfrequencyPenalty\n: A penalty applied to tokens that are frequently generated.\npresencePenalty\n: A penalty applied to tokens that are already present in the prompt.\ncountPenalty\n: A penalty applied to tokens based on their frequency in the generated responses.\nJavaScript\nfetch(\"https://api.ai21.com/studio/v1/j2-grande/complete\", {\n  headers: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\",\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n      \"prompt\": \"These are a few of my favorite\",\n      \"numResults\": 1,\n      \"maxTokens\": 30,\n      \"temperature\": 0.7,\n      \"topKReturn\": 0,\n      \"topP\":1,\n      \"countPenalty\": {\n        \"scale\": 0,\n        \"applyToNumbers\": false,\n        \"applyToPunctuations\": false,\n        \"applyToStopwords\": false,\n        \"applyToWhitespaces\": false,\n        \"applyToEmojis\": false\n      },\n      \"frequencyPenalty\": {\n        \"scale\": 0,\n        \"applyToNumbers\": false,\n        \"applyToPunctuations\": false,\n        \"applyToStopwords\": false,\n        \"applyToWhitespaces\": false,\n        \"applyToEmojis\": false\n      },\n      \"presencePenalty\": {\n        \"scale\": 0,\n        \"applyToNumbers\": false,\n        \"applyToPunctuations\": false,\n        \"applyToStopwords\": false,\n        \"applyToWhitespaces\": false,\n        \"applyToEmojis\": false\n      },\n      \"stopSequences\":[\"##\"]\n    }),\n  method: \"POST\"\n});\nJSON\n{\n  \"id\": \"75a54d20-dda1-6db7-ff99-59b1af4fdfd3\",\n  \"prompt\": {\n    \"text\": \"These are a few of my favorite\",\n    \"tokens\": [\n      {\n        \"generatedToken\": {\n          \"token\": \"\u2581These\u2581are\",\n          \"logprob\": -8.139219284057617,\n          \"raw_logprob\": -8.139219284057617\n        },\n        \"topTokens\": null,\n        \"textRange\": {\n          \"start\": 0,\n          \"end\": 9\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"generatedToken\": {\n          \"token\": \"\u2581a\u2581few\",\n          \"logprob\": -4.903847694396973,\n          \"raw_logprob\": -4.903847694396973\n        },\n        \"topTokens\": null,\n        \"textRange\": {\n          \"start\": 9,\n          \"end\": 15\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"generatedToken\": {\n          \"token\": \"\u2581of\u2581my\u2581favorite\",\n          \"logprob\": -1.543039321899414,\n          \"raw_logprob\": -1.543039321899414\n        },\n        \"topTokens\": null,\n        \"textRange\": {\n          \"start\": 15,\n          \"end\": 30\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"completions\": [\n    {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"text\": \" things!\\n\\nI love entertaining, entertaining and decorating my home, entertaining clients, entertaining friends, entertaining family...you get the point!

Even with extensive prompt engineering, OpenAI\u2019s results showed no significant improvements.\nSome noteworthy stats:\nSummarize API has an\n18% higher pass rate\nthan OpenAI\u2019s Davinci-003, even when a detailed prompt was used.\nSummarize API presents a\n19% higher faithfulness score\nin comparison to OpenAI\u2019s Davinci-003.\nSummarize API achieved a\n27% higher compression rate\nthan GPT-3.5-Turbo.\nSummarize API has at least a\n50% lower standard deviation of compression rate\n, meaning that summaries are consistent in their short length.\nTakeaways\nAI21 Labs' Summarize API outperforms or on par with OpenAI's LLM results across a variety of models, datasets and prompt types.\nThe Summarize API holds other advantages as well. As an off-the-shelf solution that does not require prompting, it can generate summaries with only the original text as input. This provides a better user experience and more consistency in results.\nNotably, human evaluation found OpenAI summaries to contain higher rates of hallucinations, reasoning violations and incoherence \u2013 common and costly limitations in LLMs that produce unacceptable results in real-world usage.\nTo learn more about the research and results, read the full whitepaper here.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nYuval Belfer\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture.

Not so long ago, the answer to this question was \u2018No!\u2019. Today, thanks to large language models, practitioners with different levels of expertise can build applications that generate useful text for marketing, content writing and more.\nHold on tight, because in this blog post we\u2019re going to go from an idea to a completely new text generation feature that you can ship immediately. Ready to get started?\nMotivation\nSuppose you're building a job marketplace app or a personnel recruitment platform. You probably have a feature that lets candidates upload their CV to your system. Those CVs aren't always stellar. For example, many of them lack a profile section - a short paragraph that highlights the candidate\u2019s background, skills and ambitions. Luckily, you can use AI21 Studio to help your users by auto-generating a CV profile for them. This is just one example of short-form content generation, where language models are used to draft text up to a paragraph long (more examples are in the summary).\nIn this post we'll build a CV profile generator that you can integrate into your application or website in just a few minutes of work.\nStep 1: Define the problem\nUnderstanding what kind of text you want to generate is essential. In this case we need to ask ourselves:  what makes a good CV profile that our users will appreciate? Let\u2019s take a look at some examples and try to find ones we like.\nHere\nis an article you can find online that shows various types of CV profiles. For example, let\u2019s look at a profile for a chemical engineer:\nI am a dedicated, hardworking and proactive Chemical Engineer with a strong background in design, plant operations, offshore operations, and process and safety improvements. I have solid work experience in designing, testing and analysing processes to increase the overall efficiency of operations. I am currently looking for an opportunity to utilise my technical skills in a challenging working environment and become a valuable asset to the organization that I work for.\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a short paragraph that covers the candidates background, experience and the type of role they are looking for. Browsing through more examples, it is clear that most CV profiles follow this pattern. Let\u2019s make a note of a few examples (3-5 will do) that we like. Our goal is to generate texts similar to these examples. Now we are ready to log into the AI21 Studio and start building.\nStep 2: Create your (initial) prompt\nLanguage models take in some text as input and generate some likely continuation of that text. We call the input text the\nprompt\nand the generated text the\ncompletion\n. You can think of large language models as smart auto-completion algorithms: they are very good at latching on to hints and patterns expressed in plain English, and generating text that follows the same patterns.\nFor example, if we input a prompt that is likely to be followed by a CV profile, we can get the model to generate new and original CV profiles as completions. One simple way to do this is to spell out an instruction, just like you would when asking a person to produce some text:\nLet\u2019s take this prompt and see what the model will generate. Go to the AI21 Studio, put this prompt in the input field and click \u201cgenerated\u201d. This is the completion the model generated:\nMr George Mwangi is a Teacher who has completed Diploma, Degree and Masters Degree in Education. He has vast teaching experience of 7 years. His expertise is in the field of Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics. He is a hardworking, dedicated candidate with vast experience of teaching various levels, including University students.\nWhat do we like about this completion?\nIt matches the profession we provided (Teacher).\nIt contains relevant education and experience.\nIt uses some good adjectives.\nWhat do we not like about this completion?\nThis paragraph is written in third person (\u201cMr Mwangi is\u2026\u201d), whereas our good CV profile examples are always written in the first person (\u201cI am\u2026\u201d).\nThe details the model generated are completely made up - they may or may not reflect our candidates' true skills.\nHow can we make the model produce the output we want?\nYou can try to phrase the instruction differently. Be descriptive and clear, and try a few different ones, like:\nFollowing is an exceptional CV profile for a Teacher:\nor\nHere is an enthusiastic Teacher\u2019s CV profile:\nThat said, you shouldn't spend too much time on choosing the perfect adjectives.\nThe most powerful tool you have at your disposal is providing examples that demonstrate what you expect from the model. This is the most effective way to guide the generations according to your intentions, and if you have time to do only one thing - this is it.\nIn this case, we already collected some relevant examples in Step 1. All that\u2019s left is to create the prompt from instruction-profile pairs. Below you can find a prompt we made by stringing together a sequence of examples we liked. The bold text is the completion our model generated.\nWrite a winning Sales/retail CV profile:\nI am a mature, positive and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task. In my previous role as a Sales Representative, I demonstrated the ability to work under intense pressure, sell products and services to customers from all backgrounds, handle customer complaints and solve problematic situations as and when they arose. I was promoted twice for exceeding my sales targets.\nWrite a winning Teaching CV profile:\nI am a loyal, talented and caring teacher who loves making a difference in the lives of young children. I am open-minded, patient and supportive towards other people, especially towards children or those who suffer from disabilities. In my previous role as a primary school teacher, I have taught and nurtured more than 100 pupils from all backgrounds, successfully preparing them for the next stages of their young lives.\nWrite a winning Media CV profile:\nI am a professional, ambitious and highly skilled Camera Operator able to use a wide range of technical equipment, including professional cinematography camcorders. I have extensive experience working on a number of television and theatre projects, demonstrating an ability to follow artistic direction and the physical capability required on a professional production set. I am comfortable filming on-location and outside the studio with some previous work experience in live broadcasting.\nWrite a winning Software Engineer CV profile:\nI am a highly talented Software Engineer with extensive experience of developing complex software systems. I have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, which allow me to quickly identify and resolve problems. I am self-motivated, able to work on my own initiative and as part of a team. I have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and I am able to communicate effectively with people from a wide range of backgrounds.\nDid we solve all the problems? Well, the profile is written in first person, just like we wanted. Unfortunately, it still contains made up details. We solve this in the following section.\nThere are a couple of important things to note here:\nThe instruction we chose was \u201cWrite a winning \u2026 CV profile:\u201d. It\u2019s good to be consistent and use the exact same phrasing throughout the examples in the prompt.\nEach CV profile ends with a pair of hashes, which establishes a pattern for the model to follow. As a result, when the model produces a new CV profile in the completion, it generates \u2018##\u2019 after it. We can use this signal to detect that the entire profile has been written and terminate the generation using the\nstop sequence parameter\nWant to see the generation or check another profile?\nTry it yourself in our playground\nStep 3: Add personalization to your prompt\nThe prompt we have at this point produces well-formatted, impressive-sounding CV profiles for specific roles. You can try it in the playground and see that it\u2019s pretty reliable. Each time we generate a new text, we get a random profile for a candidate for the desired role.\nAlthough the profiles fit the role, they may be inconsistent with the candidates' actual skills, experience and ambitions. You probably want to provide your users a way to guide the generated profile to stick to the facts that are true for them. One way to do it is to inject specific features that you want to be reflected in the profile into the instruction.\nWe took the prompt from the previous section and tweaked it to include \u201cfeatures\u201d. We extracted them manually from the examples we gathered earlier. This is the completion generated by the model:\nWrite a winning Business management CV profile incorporating the following features:\n1. Logical mind\n2. Problem solver\n3. 2 years of experience in management\n4. Eager to learn\nWrite a winning IT CV profile incorporating the following features:\nI am a highly competent IT professional with a proven track record in designing websites, networking and managing databases. I have strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to interact with a wide range of clients. I am eager to be challenged in order to grow and further improve my IT skills. My greatest passion is in life is using my technical know-how to benefit other people and organisations.\nWrite a winning Sales Executive CV profile incorporating the following features:\n1. Energetic and ambitious\n2. 6 years of selling experience\n3. Love working in a team\n4. Independent\n5. MBA from Stanford\nYou can see that now we can direct the model to include specific skills and experience!\nWant to see how your features turn into a profile?\nTry here\n.\nWhen working with prompts like these, it is critical to maintain a strong correlation between the features and the generation. If an example's output mentions facts that totally contradict the input or are completely original and unrelated, the model will follow suit and have a tendency to make up things. We call this phenomenon \u201challucinations\u201d. On the other hand, if you omit certain features from an example's output, the model will imitate this and occasionally drop some of the provided features.\nTo understand that, let\u2019s take a look at the following bad example (do NOT try this at home!):\nWrite a winning Business manager CV profile incorporating the following features:\n1. Creative person\n2. experience in management\n3. Have an MBA from Stanford\nI have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. I have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. I am eager to learn, I enjoy overcoming challenges, and I have a genuine interest in Business Management and making organisations successful.\nWrite a winning IT manager CV profile incorporating the following features:\n1. Experience IT professional\n2. Record designing websites, networking and managing databases\n3. Excellent interpersonal skills\n4. Looking for a challenge\nProfile:\nHaving 3 years experience in all aspects of IT, including web design, networking, databases and technical support. I am looking for a new challenge. I thrive in challenging environments and I am committed to high standards in all aspects of my work.\n##\nA single example (Business manager) was fed into the model here, but there is some mismatch between some skills and the profile. The table below shows both phenomena in this example: What was wrong with the prompt, and how it affected the completion.\nPrompt (Business manager)\nCompletion (IT manager)\nHallucination\n2 years of experience\n3 years of experience\nOmission\nCreativity, MBA\ninterpersonal skills\nStep 4: Explore the parameters\nAnother way to affect the completion is to adjust some of the generation parameters. There are quite a few parameters and you can learn about them\nhere\n. For now, let's focus on one of the most significant parameters: Temperature.\nThe temperature controls creativity. Increasing the temperature tends to result in more varied and creative completions, whereas decreasing it produces more stable and repetitive completions. With temperature set to zero, the model will always generate the most probable completion for a given prompt (which will be the same completion every time).\nBelow are examples of three different generations using the same prompt from the previous step:\nTemperature\nCompletion\n0\nI am an energetic and ambitious Sales Executive with 6 years of selling experience. I am a team player, but I am also able to work on my own initiative. I am an MBA from Stanford, and I am looking for a challenging position where I can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation.\n0.7\nI am ambitious, energetic and hard-working. Over the last 6 years, I have gained valuable experience in selling products and services to businesses and consumers. I possess strong communication and presentation skills and I am a team player. I am good at building relationships with clients and I am known for my integrity and honesty. I am currently studying for an MBA from Stanford. I am confident that I can build a successful career in sales.\n1\nI am an extremely ambitious and energetic individual with 6 years of selling experience. I have a strong Business Administration degree, along with an MBA from Stanford, which has increased my market knowledge. I am a team player who thrives in challenging environments and relishes the opportunity to work autonomously.\nWant to see more results?\nTry it yourself\nin the playground!\nStep 5: Integrate with your code\nAfter you've finished building your prompt and you are happy with the results you see in the playground, you'd want to integrate some code to call the AI21 Studio API in your product. You can click the API button and copy the necessary code snippet.\nThe request includes your API key (which is linked to your account), certain parameters, and more importantly - the prompt. In production the prompt will need to end with a different input every time we generate a completion, corresponding to the role and the candidate features. We'll need to write a bit of code that injects this into our prompt. Here's how you would do it in Python:\ndef create_prompt(role, highlights):\n    \"\"\"\n        Arguments:\n        - role         : what is the profession of the candidate\n        - highlights   : what are the skills and ambitions of the candidate\n\n        Returns:\n        - prompt       : a full prompt, including few shot examples\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    few_shot_prompt = #Paste here the few shot prompt, ends with the stop sequence#\n    current_input = f\"Write a winning {role} incorporating the following features:\\n\"\n    skills_str = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(highlights)):\n        skills_str += f\"{i + 1:d}. {highlights[i]}\\n\"\n    skills_str += \"\\nProfile:\"\n\n    return few_shot_prompt + current_input + skills_str\nCheck out this\nnotebook\nfor more details.\nSummary\nIn this post, we have explored the process of going from an idea to an implementation of a short-form text generation feature with AI21 Studio. Other examples of short-form text that you can generate with AI21 Studio are\ntweets\nonline ads\n,\nproduct descriptions\nand more.\nCreating a good prompt is a process that involves some trial and error, but it doesn't require a PhD in AI. So don't give up if your first attempt fails to produce good results.

Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nTutorial\nBuild a CV profile generator using AI21 Studio\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation.

To do so, simply run the following command:\nTerminal\n$ pip install ai21\nBefore you can start using the SDK, you'll need to obtain your API key from\nAI21 Studio\n. Once you have your API key, you can set it globally in your Python code like this:\nimport ai21\nai21.api_key = <YOUR_API_KEY>\nTo generate text using Jurassic-2 language models, you need to provide a prompt for the model to complete. We recommend following our\nPrompt Engineering\nbest practices to achieve the best results.\nHere are a couple of examples of prompts you can use to get started:\n\"Zero Shot\" prompt:\nprompt = \"These are a few of my favorite\"\n\"Few Shot\" prompt:\nprompt = \"\"\"\nComplete the following sentence.\nSentence: These are a few of my favorite\nCompletion: things. Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels.\n\n##\n\nComplete the following sentence.\nSentence: These are a few of my favorite\nCompletion: rock bands: The Beatles, The Doors, Fleetwood Mac.\n\n##\n\nComplete the following sentence.\nSentence: These are a few of my favorite\nCompletion:\n\"\"\"\nBelow is a sample usage of the AI21 Python SDK to interact with Jurassic-2 models, demonstrating some of the frequently utilized parameters:\nimport ai21\nai21.api_key = <YOUR_API_KEY>\n\n# J2 Grande\nresponse_grande = ai21.Completion.execute(\n  model=\"j2-grande\",\n  prompt=\"These are a few of my favorite\",\n  numResults=1,\n  maxTokens=2,\n  temperature=0.4,\n  topKReturn=0,\n  topP=1,\n  stopSequences=[\"##\"]\n)\n\n# J2 Grande Instruct\nresponse_grande_instruct = ai21.Completion.execute(\n  model=\"j2-grande-instruct\",\n  prompt=\"explain black holes to 8th graders\",\n  numResults=1,\n  maxTokens=100,\n  temperature=0.7,\n  topKReturn=0,\n  topP=1,\n  stopSequences=[\"##\"]\n)\n\nprint(response_grande)\nprint(response_grande_instruct)\nBy customizing these parameters, you can control the content and style of the generated text.

Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nNLP in the 21st century\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture.

Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nNatural language understanding as the next frontier\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router.

They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

To do so, simply run the following command:\nTerminal\n$ pip install -U ai21[SM]\nTo use the AI21 Studio Python SDK with SageMaker, first, create an Amazon SageMaker instance and configure it. Then, install the AI21 Studio Python SDK with SageMaker integration using the command mentioned above. After setting up the environment, you can follow the same steps as described in the AI21 Studio Python SDK Guide for Jurassic-2 models.\nBelow is a sample usage of the AI21 Python SDK with SageMaker integration to interact with Jurassic-2 models:\nPython\nimport ai21\n\n# J2 Grande\nresponse_grande = ai21.Completion.execute(\n  sm_endpoint=\"j2-grande\",\n  prompt=\"These are a few of my favorite\",\n  numResults=1,\n  maxTokens=2,\n  temperature=0.4\n)\n\n# J2 Grande Instruct\nresponse_grande_instruct = ai21.Completion.execute(\n  sm_endpoint=\"j2-grande-instruct\",\n  prompt=\"explain black holes to 8th graders\",\n  numResults=1,\n  maxTokens=100,\n  temperature=0.7\n)\n\nprint(response_grande)\nprint(response_grande_instruct)\nBy customizing the request parameters, you can control the content and style of the generated text. For a full list of available options, check out our\nComplete API\npage.\nAll Jurassic-2 models can be interacted with using the same ai21.Completion.execute() function, including j2-large, j2-grande, j2-jumbo, j2-grande-instruct, and j2-grande-jumbo.\nHere's an example of a response object from executing a j2-grande model:\nJSON\n{\n   \"id\":\"94078cb6-687e-4262-ef8f-1d7c2b0dbd2b\",\n   \"prompt\":{\n      \"text\":\"These are a few of my favorite\",\n      \"tokens\":[\n         {\n            \"generatedToken\":{\n               \"token\":\"\u2581These\u2581are\",\n               \"logprob\":-8.824776649475098,\n               \"raw_logprob\":-8.824776649475098\n            },\n            \"topTokens\":\"None\",\n            \"textRange\":{\n               \"start\":0,\n               \"end\":9\n            }\n         },\n         {\n            \"generatedToken\":{\n               \"token\":\"\u2581a\u2581few\",\n               \"logprob\":-4.798709869384766,\n               \"raw_logprob\":-4.798709869384766\n            },\n            \"topTokens\":\"None\",\n            \"textRange\":{\n               \"start\":9,\n               \"end\":15\n            }\n         },\n         {\n            \"generatedToken\":{\n               \"token\":\"\u2581of\u2581my\u2581favorite\",\n               \"logprob\":-1.0864331722259521,\n               \"raw_logprob\":-1.0864331722259521\n            },\n            \"topTokens\":\"None\",\n            \"textRange\":{\n               \"start\":15,\n               \"end\":30\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   },\n   \"completions\":[\n      {\n         \"data\":{\n            \"text\":\" things \u2013\",\n            \"tokens\":[\n               {\n                  \"generatedToken\":{\n                     \"token\":\"\u2581things\",\n                     \"logprob\":-0.0003219324571546167,\n                     \"raw_logprob\":-0.47372230887413025\n                  },\n                  \"topTokens\":\"None\",\n                  \"textRange\":{\n                     \"start\":0,\n                     \"end\":7\n                  }\n               },\n               {\n                  \"generatedToken\":{\n                     \"token\":\"\u2581\u2013\",\n                     \"logprob\":-7.797079563140869,\n                     \"raw_logprob\":-4.319167613983154\n                  },\n                  \"topTokens\":\"None\",\n                  \"textRange\":{\n                     \"start\":7,\n                     \"end\":9\n                  }\n               }\n            ]\n...Text Truncated...\n\nThe response is a nested data structure containing information about the processed request, prompt, and completions.

In large language models the context window refers to the limited amount of tokens the model considers when generating a response. The context window acts as a threshold for the amount of tokens in the prompt and the completion, namely: prompt + completion <= context window. As an estimate for your use-case: the average token size in our tokenizer is six characters.

The playground exists for a reason, so try out different prompt structures to see what works best for you. Found it? Use this exact structure to train your model.\nTest the different models on the playground before choosing what to train on.\nModel training is not a one-time affair, but an iterative process.\nIn cases of complex tasks, we recommend training several versions on smaller parts of your dataset to root out any problems in the data (that cannot be identified by few-shots alone), as well as setting the correct hyperparameters.\nWe selected the default hyperparameters after testing several benchmarks and choosing those that gave optimal results across the board. Nevertheless, if your trained model doesn't work as expected, you may want to train another version with different hyperparameters.\nSometimes custom models work better when fed a few-shot prompt. Be sure to perform some calls with few-shot prompts when testing your trained model.\nThere is no guarantee that more epochs will provide a better result. From our experience, this is especially true when you want your model to generate expressive and diverse content. A relatively short training will help retain J-1\u2019s original abilities. Longer training will provide a model that behaves more like the data in your dataset (for good or bad).\nThe model reflects the data\n, so if the data has biases, the model will learn the bias. For example, if most of your data begins with the words \u201cI think that\u201d, then the model will learn to give high probability for these words. This can help in debugging the model, so look at the probabilities (using alternative tokens) to understand the biases in the data.\nFor classification tasks, try to balance the data, meaning an equal number of examples for each class.\nUpdated\n4 months ago", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-tricks"}, {"title": "Transitioning to Jurassic-2: Important Updates on Model Retirements and Pricing Changes", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nBack to All\nTransitioning to Jurassic-2: Important Updates on Model Retirements and Pricing Changes\n22 days ago\nby Yotam Shinan\nWe have a few updates to share regarding our Jurassic models at AI21 Studio:\nJurassic-1 Models Retirement\n: As of June 1st, 2023, all Jurassic-1 models will be retired.

And that's not all - we're also releasing our task-specific APIs, with plug-and-play reading and writing capabilities that outperform competitors.\nOur focus at AI21 Studio is to help developers and businesses leverage reading and writing AI to build real-world products with tangible value. Today marks two important milestones with the release of Jurassic-2 and Task-Specific APIs, empowering you to bring generative AI to production.\n(or J2, as we like to call it) is the next generation of our foundation models with significant improvements in quality and new capabilities including zero-shot instruction-following, reduced latency, and multi-language support.\nTask-specific APIs\nprovide developers with industry-leading APIs that perform specialized reading and writing tasks out-of-the box.\nRead on for an in-depth look at each.\nJurassic-2\nWe\u2019re proud to present our brand new family of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. J2 not only improves upon Jurassic-1 (our previous generation models) in every aspect, but it also offers new features and capabilities that put it in a league of its own.\nThe Jurassic-2 family includes base language models in three different sizes: Large, Grande and Jumbo, alongside instruction-tuned language models for Jumbo and Grande.\nJurassic is already making waves on\nStanford\u2019s Holistic Evaluation of Language Models\n(HELM), the leading benchmark for language models. Currently, J2 Jumbo ranks second (and climbing) according to an evaluation we conducted using HELM\u2019s official repository. No less important, our mid-sized model (Grande) ranks significantly higher than models up to 30x larger in size, enabling users to optimize production costs and speed without needing to sacrifice quality.\nWhat's new compared to Jurassic-1?\nImproved quality\nWith cutting-edge pre-training methods combined with the latest data (current up to mid-2022), J2\u2019s Jumbo model has scored an 86.8% win-rate on HELM by our internal evaluations, solidifying it as a top-tier option in the LLM space.\nInstruct capabilities\nJ2\u2019s best-in-class models offer zero-shot instruction capabilities, allowing them to be steered with natural language without the use of examples. J2\u2019s Jumbo and Grande models have been adapted to include these capabilities. Here's an example:\nMultilingual support\nJ2 supports several non-English languages, including Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch.\nPerformance\nIn terms of latency, J2\u2019s models can perform up to 30% faster than our previous models.\nTake it for a spin\nJurassic-2 will be\navailable for free\nuntil May 1st, 2023. In addition, Jurassic-2 and Jurassic-1 models are now offered under our new reduced and simplified\npricing model,\nbased on the total length of text (input + output).\nAll Jurassic-2 models are now available for you on our playground and API. To help you get started, we\u2019ve collected some tips and tricks for working with the new Instruct models\nhere\n.\nToday, AI21 Labs is also proud to announce our new line of\nTask-Specific APIs\n, with the launch of the\nWordtune API set,\ngiving developers access to the language models behind our massively popular consumer-facing reading and writing apps.\nWhy do we need Task-Specific APIs?\nGeneral Large Language Models are incredibly powerful, and many of our customers have successfully customized them to power their applications. However, we\u2019ve also seen that certain use-cases recur frequently among many users.\nBy providing developers with task-specific APIs, they can leap over much of the needed model training and fine-tuning stages, allowing them to take full advantage of our ready-made best-in-class language processing solutions.\n \nand\nboth use cutting-edge AI to assist users with writing and reading tasks \u2013 all while saving time and improving performance.\nWith the release of\nWordtune API\n, we\u2019re giving developers access to the AI engine behind this award-winning line of applications, allowing them to take full advantage of Wordtune\u2019s capabilities and integrate them into their own apps:\nParaphrase\nReword texts to fit any tone, length, or meaning.\nSummarize\n-\nCondense lengthy texts into easy-to-read bite-sized summaries.\nGrammatical Error Correction (GEC)\n- Catch and fix grammatical errors and typos on the fly.\nText Improvements\n- Get recommendations to increase text fluency, enhance vocabulary, and improve clarity.\nText Segmentation\n- Break down long pieces of text into paragraphs segmented by distinct topic.\nOutperforming the Competition\nWhen it comes to paraphrasing and summarizing capabilities, Wordtune API is truly a best-in-class performer.\nSummarize API\nFaithfulness rates measure how factually consistent a summary is with the original text. As you can see below, our new Summarize API has reached a faithfulness rate that outperforms OpenAI\u2019s Davinci-003 by 19%.\nAcceptance rates measure how satisfied human evaluators are with the quality of generated summaries, and we\u2019re proud to say that our Summarize API has achieved an acceptance rate that is 18% higher than that of OpenAI\u2019s.\nParaphrase API\nOur Paraphrase API\u2019s latency is approximately\na 1/3 of OpenAI\u2019s.\nOur Paraphrase API outperforms OpenAI both in terms of diversity of results\n(33%)\nas well as meaning preservation\n(8%).\nQQP benchmark:\nSTS-B benchmark:\nThe new releases of the Jurassic models and Task-Specific APIs both demonstrate our commitment to providing cutting-edge technology that enables our customers to build better language processing applications with ease, and deploy them into production in minutes.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nAnnouncing Jurassic-2 and Task-Specific APIs\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture.

MRKL systems include one or more language models, and augment them with external knowledge sources as well as symbolic reasoning experts that can handle tasks that lie beyond the reach of neural models.\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

For example, you should keep the same instruction for each input and make sure the number of spaces is identical.\nFinish each prompt with a newline, or start every completion with a whitespace. Make sure you do the same for the entire dataset.\nMake sure the examples in your dataset reflect the type of tasks the model will face. Examples:\nIf you are generating copy for a wide variety of industries, you should have examples from all these industries in your dataset.\nIf you\u2019re building a model that generates movie taglines and only train it on comedies, it won\u2019t do a great job in generating horror movie taglines.\nYou should clearly define what you expect from the output and then create examples that show these expectations. If you expect information from the input to appear in the output, provide only examples that follow that logical path. Every completion in your dataset should be something you will be happy to get from the model.\nYour model is as good as your data. Make sure you are providing your best examples.\nAlthough 50 is the minimum, try to provide more examples, if possible. If you end up with 50 examples, make sure you provide a large variety to avoid overfitting the model to certain types of examples.\nMake sure your dataset is clean and has no wrong, empty or duplicated examples.\nRemove duplicates to prevent data leakage - otherwise, you can end up with an example that appears both in train and test, and the test loss will not reflect the \u201ctrue\u201d loss.\nJust like with few-shot prompts, having a clear instruction may help, even the phrasing of your prompt matters, and it\u2019s not an exact science. Try different variations and see what works best.\nAs opposed to few-shot prompts, here, you don\u2019t need to end your generations with a distinctive token (e.g ##). The model learns when to finish the generation and it will simply provide a completion and nothing else.\nUpdated\n4 months ago", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset"}, {"title": "Pricing", "text": "Product\nLog In\nStart Building\nStart with a free trial, no credit card required, then pay based on usage.\nSee usage pricing for\nFoundation, Instruct, Custom Models\nand\nTask-Specific APIs.\nStarter Plan\nAccess all features through usage-based pricing,\nwith a minimum subscription fee of $29 per month.\nAccess all features through usage-based pricing, with a minimum subscription fee of $29 per month.\nUsage-based pricing\nFoundation model APIs & SDK\nCustom model training\nUnlimited seats\nFree Trial\n$90 credits for 3 months\nNo credit card needed\nStart Now For FREE\nCustom Plan\nFor developers who are looking to scale, require custom implementation or dedicated support.\nEverything in the Starter Plan\nVolume discounts\nPremium API rate limits\nPrivate cloud hosting\nPriority support\nDedicated account manager\nExpert AI consultancy\nContact Sales\nFoundation Models\nBase, Instruct and Custom models\nJurassic foundation models\nare trained on a massive corpus of text, making them a powerful basis for a wide range of natural language processing applications, capable of understanding & composing human-like text.\nRanked best-in-class by Stanford\nUniversity's HELM index.\nTrain custom models with exceptional flexibility.\nUse your fine-tuned models at no extra cost.\nJumbo\nHighest quality\n$0.015 / 1k tokens\n$3\nGrande\n(Base & Instruct)\nQuality & speed\n$0.01 / 1k tokens\n$0.5\nLarge\n(Base)\nFastest\n$0.003 / 1k tokens\nFine-Tuning\nTrain a custom model\n$0.1\n/MB /epoch\nWhat is a Token?\nTokens are used in language models to break down text into small pieces.

In the past, computer adventure games were limited in terms of the amount of actions and scenarios they offered. By using Large Language Models, AI Dungeon grants players the flexibility to perform virtually any action and have the game respond to that action.\nExample from AI Dungeon\nLatitude got good traction with its early implementation of AI Dungeon on top of GPT-3, but when planning their future roadmap, they quickly realized that they needed an LLM partner who shared their vision of immersive AI-driven experiences. They found an eager partner in AI21 Labs, who worked collaboratively with Latitude to discover roadblocks and brainstorm solutions. This resulted in improvements to issues such as latency, flexibility, and user satisfaction, to name just a few.\nSo, how did they do it?\nAI21 Labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at Latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost efficiency. Latitude found AI21 Labs to be a collaborative LLM partner, which wasn\u2019t just a plug-and-play solution to a scaling problem, but rather a trusted partner with whom they could collaborate on AI solutions.\nBut what were the exact problems preventing Latitude from realizing its vision? And how did AI21 Labs overcome them? Read on for the full story.\nWho is Latitude?\nLatitude was never envisioned as a gaming company - it actually started as a Hackathon project that translated into a Dungeons and Dragons plugin. The team decided to go to market with the plugin, and within the first week, they had roughly 100,000 customers which quickly grew to a million in just the first month.\nThe verdict was in: there was a creative use case for large language models for game-like experiences and writing.\nSearching for a collaborative solution\nLatitude wanted to offer a stronger game experience, with richer text and better AI responses. For this, they partnered with the legacy GPT-3 enterprise, OpenAI.\nBut with rapidly evolving technology came growing pains, and OpenAI was not aligned with Latitude's vision - thus, the visionary gaming experience became impossible. It became clear to Latitude that they needed to seek out a new tech partner who was interested in solving the use case of creating an AI-Driven adventure role play game..\nSwitching from OpenAI to AI21 Labs\nLatitude booked a call with AI21 Labs when they\u2019d just launched their Jurassic-1 Model. A Jurassic prototype was set up for Latitude, and they started experimenting with the features and the accuracy of results. The final model was perfect for Latitude\u2019s AI Dungeon use case. Soon after that, the team declared it an alpha model for their audience.\nIn order to get to that stage, the teams had to overcome two massive roadblocks.\nThe first roadblock: creative restrictions\nOpenAI\u2019s policy of non-violence restricted integral elements of Latitude\u2019s AI Dungeon adventures \u2014 quests, swords, and fights. It was impossible to have a role playing expedition without weapons.\n\u201cWe were interested in a partner who understands the nuances of the creative use case.\u201d\nsays Ryan Seamons, VP of Product at Latitude.\nRyan Seamons - VP Product @ Latitude\nLatitude prioritized finding a partner who was not only aligned philosophically but willing to become a true partner and collaborator in building a quality AI-driven role-play experience.\n\u201cWe need to offer AI-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players. We need models that are fast, reliable, and creative.\u201d\nThe collaborative opportunity: agility\nAI21 Labs\u2019 team of developers, creators, and stakeholders were analytical problem-solvers who created reliable production models for Latitude.\nA precise production model is critical for a gaming company like Latitude. It defines the customer experience and determines whether users will come back. So, it needs to be hyper-accurate and reliable. To achieve this, there has to be excellent communication during prototyping.\nLatitude and AI21 Labs had a system for rapid back-and-forth between teams and numerous collaborative checkpoints. As a result, they got to the production stage quickly.\nEven after launching the model, the AI21 Labs team worked tirelessly to ship updates, create new features, and build on feedback.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve experimented with other tools, but they have been demanding and daunting with direct orders and no problem-solving. But not AI21 (Labs). They\u2019re enthusiastic, collaborative, and innovative \u2014 a true gaming visionary.\u201d\nThe second problem: exponential costs\nLatitude offers AI-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players.\nNot only did Latitude want to offer existing models to new players, they also wanted to create more immersive and realistic worlds.\nThey wanted an LLM partner who offered customizable pricing because gaming models are extremely expensive to run at scale.\n\u201cAI costs are one of our most significant ongoing expenses, and so finding ways to reduce our AI costs help us to operate sustainably as a business.\u201d\nThe collaborative opportunity: cost-effectiveness through optimization\nAI21 Labs put in hours of skilled talent to make the large language model efficient enough to be cost-effective. They helped Latitude transition from Jurassic-1 Jumbo to Jurassic-1 Grande to scale performance at the right cost.\nJurassic-1 Jumbo, AI21\u2019s biggest model, processes 178 billion parameters to generate an output. But after running multiple experiments, their team concluded that Latitude\u2019s game did not need this many parameters. They switched from Jumbo to Grande (which uses 17B parameters), and the result was the perfect sweet spot for a compelling experience at a sustainable price with faster response time. The cost savings are great, but the faster response times are also something players can benefit from. The lower costs also let Latitude experiment with additional ways to improve output quality, such as Hydra mode which generates multiple responses and selects the best one for a player.\nBeing able to experiment with new data sets more quickly and affordably also yielded positive results and will be a major part of Latitude\u2019s AI strategy this year.\n\u201c\nThe biggest benefit of working with AI21 (Labs) is for agile companies who want more hands-on attention in service.\nWhat I\u2019ve been most impressed with is the proactiveness in optimizing costs for multiple use cases. It\u2019s been a breath of fresh air compared to competitors.\u201d\nsays Seamons.\nThe final results\nLatitude discovered that the Grande model struck the right balance of cost vs. performance, all while generating higher quality results than small models such as GPT-J or GPT-3 Curie.\nBy using an ensemble model approach called Hydra, Latitude was able to achieve quality similar to that of larger models.\nAt every stage, the team at AI21 Labs devised innovative solutions to roadblocks and proactively and continuously improved cost efficiency.\nWhether through large-scale prototyping or improving production after release, Latitude found AI21 Labs to be a creative, efficient, and reliable partner on every level.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nHow Latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs\nTwo years ago, Latitude wanted to scale its imaginative AI use cases and the number of players. Latitude found a collaborative LLM partner in AI21 Labs. AI21 Labs wasn\u2019t only a plug-and-play solution to a scaling problem, they became a specialized partner who proactively detected gaming roadblocks and brainstormed solution prototypes. AI21 managed to build enterprise-level production models for individual players at Latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost efficiency for Latitude.\n \nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

The feedback was incredible. In fact, while Grande is significantly closer in size to J1-Large (7.5B parameters), a great majority of users have found that J1-Grande\u2019s quality is comparable to that of J1-Jumbo (178B parameters). This is great news for all budget-conscious practitioners; J1-Grande, our mid-size model, offers access to supreme quality text generation at a more affordable rate.\nCheck it out: we asked each of the Jurassic-1 models to generate a humorous poem about a friendship between a dog and a cat:\nYou\u2019ll find that while each of the three models composed comical (though quite meaningful) poems, Grande and Jumbo exhibit a far more sophisticated level of writing.\nTry it out for yourself\nin the AI21 Studio playground.\nWith a response time twice as fast as Jumbo, at one-third the cost of Jumbo, Grande delivers an excellent combination of price, quality and speed to even the most seemingly complex use-cases. To learn more about subscription plans, visit the\npricing page\nBenchmarks\nDistilling the quality of a language model into a single metric is notoriously difficult. Nevertheless, we find it helpful to compare the performance of different models on standard NLP tasks. Below we examine the accuracy of J1-Large, J1-Grande and J1-Jumbo on a diverse selection of tasks, including common knowledge question answering, reading comprehension and common sense.\nNone of the models were trained specifically for the tasks presented. We compared the models in two distinct circumstances:\nFew-shot: demonstrating with a few examples of ideal outputs for it to mimic (as seen\n)\nZero-shot: void of any guidance whatsoever (as seen\nhere\n).\nData indicates the average accuracy of the broad range of tasks assigned to the Jurassic-1 models in experiments of both Zero-shot and Few-shot.Zero-shot trials included ARC-Challenge, ARC-Easy, BoolQ, HellaSwag, PIQA, RACE-high, RACE-middle, RTE, StoryCloze, and Winogrande. Few-shot trails included ARC-Challenge, ARC-Easy, OpenBookQA, BoolQ, RTE, StoryCloze and Winogrande. All tasks were posed in a multiple-choice format. See Jurassic-1\nwhite paper\nfor more details.\nThe perplexity (PPL) of Jurassic-1 models is illustrated by average log-probabilities per byte, where a higher number is a more impressive figure.

Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

Jurassic-1 models come in two sizes, where the Jumbo version, at 178B parameters, is the largest and most sophisticated language model ever released for general use by developers. AI21 Studio is currently in open beta, allowing anyone to sign up and immediately start querying Jurassic-1 using our API and interactive web environment.\nOur mission at AI21 Labs is to fundamentally reimagine the way humans read and write by introducing machines as thought partners, and the only way we can achieve this is if we take on this challenge together. We\u2019ve been researching language models since our Mesozoic Era (aka 2017 \ud83d\ude09). Jurassic-1 builds on this research, and it is the first generation of models we\u2019re making available for widespread use.\nJurassic-1 models are highly versatile, capable of both human-like text generation, as well as solving complex tasks such as question answering, text classification and many others. Our models utilize a unique 250,000-token vocabulary which is not only much larger than most existing vocabularies (5x or more), but also the first to include multi-word tokens such as expressions, phrases, and named entities. Because of this, Jurassic-1 needs fewer tokens to represent a given amount of text, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing latency significantly.\nJurassic-1 in action, generating blog post ideas in AI21 Studio.\nCheck out our white paper\nfor more technical details, as well as a thorough evaluation of our models.\nIn order to help developers scale their applications beyond a proof-of-concept and efficiently serve production-scale traffic, AI21 Studio allows developers to train custom versions of Jurassic-1 models. Training a custom model is easy and requires as few as 50-100 training examples. Once trained, your custom model is served in AI21 Studio and immediately available for your exclusive use.\nWe created AI21 Studio to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technology. Using Jurassic-1 within AI21 Studio, you can quickly build text-based applications that rival those being dreamed up in the world\u2019s biggest labs, even if you have no prior experience. We\u2019ve been using AI21 Studio internally to power our own applications, and it has propelled our product development immensely.\nNow it\u2019s your turn.\nGET STARTED NOW\nTo learn more, visit our blog posts highlighting\ndifferent use-cases for Jurassic-1\nand demonstrating how to\nbootstrap a custom model in AI21 Studio\nor read the AI21 Studio\ndocumentation\n.\n \nRead our official\npress release.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nAnnouncing AI21 Studio and Jurassic-1 language models\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language.

This tutorial demonstrates the process on legal documents.\nWe\u2019ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who\nactually\nreads those terms and conditions to be honest?).\nImagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. In today's information overload age,\nnearly 30% of the workday\nis spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take\nalmost a quarter of a year\n?). Aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example,\nOnly 16% of Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing\n!).\nThis is where AI-driven summarization tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. With large language models, the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is specifically tailored to their preferences.\nLet's take legal documents, for example. Though they are written in English, many people find legal documents to be difficult to comprehend, as if they were actually written in a foreign language. Moreover, the interesting parts of each document may differ depending on the person who reads it, so off-the-shelf summarization tools may be too general or too specific. As an example, let's look at the involved personas:\nLawyers\n. They are interested in several key points, but legal language and terms are especially relevant to them.\nYour average Joe.\nDoesn\u2019t understand all the legal terms, and really wants to get the gist in simple words.\nUsing the\nIRS\nas our example, we will demonstrate here how to build a simple summarizer for those 2 personas, and discuss which future directions one should consider.\nWorking with large language models\nLarge language models naturally follow patterns in input (prompt), and provide coherent completion that follows the same patterns. For that, we want to feed them with several examples in the input (\"\nfew-shot prompt\"\n), so they can follow through. The process of creating the correct prompt for your problem is called prompt engineering, and you can read more about it\nCollecting data\nIdeally, you should have a variety of examples to draw from. It is important that those examples represent the actual documents that your summarizer should work on. This means they should be written in the same way as real world documents, and they should be as varied as possible.\nDon't have it? No need to worry - large language models generalize exceptionally well, so the results will still be good. In the end, optimal results can always be achieved with proper data - but you can revisit this at a later date.\nSummarize for lawyers\nIf you are summarizing legal documents for lawyers, you should definitely maintain all legal terms from the original document. In this demonstration, we will work on the opening paragraphs of legal letters.\n- Grandparent died and left the residue of his estate to Trust 1 and Trust 2, testamentary trusts established under Will. The trustees of Trust 1 want to divide the estate equally between Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 2.\n- Section 9(a) of Trust 1 provides that Trustees may distribute the net income to Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1's descendants in any proportion they determine is desirable.\n- Section 9(b) of Trust 1 provides that Trustees may distribute principal to Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1's descendants as they determine is desirable.\n- Section 9(c) of Trust 1 provides that if Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1's descendants all die before 21 years, Trust 1 will terminate early.\n- A taxpayer requested an extension of five years under IRC section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings.\n- A testamentary gift of stock to Taxpayer and a testamentary disposition to Granddaughter, both disqualified persons, resulted in Taxpayer having excess business holdings of Entity 1 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\n- On Date 3, Taxpayer received an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest of an LLC membership interest, which is an excess business holding.\nYou will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. Read it and summarize it. Make sure the summary maintains formal terms.\nAnd the completion:\n- The Parties requested an extension of time under \u00a7301.9100-3 of the Procedure and Administration Regulations to file an election.\n- The Parties are requesting an extension of time to file the Election Statement with respect to Purchaser's acquisition of all the stock of S Corporation Target from Shareholder on Date 1.\n- The Parties represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662.\nNotes\nIt is wise to try several phrasings for your prompt. You can, for instance, keep it simple and direct by writing:\nSummarize the following part of a legal letter while maintaining formal terms.\nAlternatively, you can take a more elaborate approach, such as:\nYou are LegalAI, an AI legal assistant that excels at summarizing legal documents.\nBelow you will find part of a legal letter. Read it and summarize it. Make sure the summary maintains formal terms.\n[LETTER]\nAs you can see, we are providing the model with several examples, separated by a stop sequence, which is easily spotted while reading the text. You can read more about stop sequences\nBecause this task requires high accuracy, we recommend working at a low temperature. It's best to explore the range of 0.0-0.3, since temperature 0 does tend to produce short summaries. You can read more about temperature\nplayground.\nThere is a consistent structure to all the examples in the prompt. This few-shot prompt can be created using the following code (assuming you have the paragraphs and summaries):\ndef make_single_example(letter, summary):\n    example = \"You will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. Read it and summarize it. Make sure the summary maintains formal terms.\\n\"\n    example += \"Letter:\\n\"\n    example += letter\n    example += \"\\n\"\n    example += \"Summary:\\n\"\n    example += summary\n    \n    return example\n\n# This is the stop sequence\nSEPARATOR = \"\\n##\\n\"\n\nFEW_SHOT_PREFIX = SEPARATOR.join(\n    make_single_example(letter, summary) for letter, summary in zip(letters, summaries)\n)\n\ndef make_few_shot_prompt(letter):\n    \n    return FEW_SHOT_PREFIX + SEPARATOR + make_single_example(letter, '') # keep the summary empty and let the model complete\nSummarize for the average Joe\nDespite the fact that there are over 1.3 million lawyers in the United States alone, most people  (still) aren't lawyers and have trouble understanding legal documents. In this case, we probably want the summary to be written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner.\nAs this task involves both summarizing and simplifying texts, it is inherently more difficult. Thus, we will probably need more \"shots\" in our few-shot prompt (in this case, we added another example to the prompt).\nHere is an example of a few-shot prompt:\nThis letter responds to your authorized representatives\u2019 letter of May 19, 2022, and subsequent correspondence, requesting rulings regarding the income, estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax consequences of the proposed division of Trust 1.\nThe facts and representations submitted are as follows:\nGrandparent died on Date 1, leaving the residue of Grandparent\u2019s probate estate in equal shares to Trust 1 and Trust 2, testamentary trusts established under Will. Trust 1 is held for the benefit of Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1\u2019s descendants, and Trust 2 is held for the benefit of Grandchild 2 and Grandchild 2\u2019s descendants. Grandchild 1 has five children, Great-Grandchild 1, Great-Grandchild 2, Great-Grandchild 3, GreatGrandchild 4, and Great-Grandchild 5. Grandchild 2 has one child, Great-Grandchild 6. Neither Grandchild 1 nor Grandchild 2 has any deceased children. Trustees serve as trustees of Trust 1. Trust 1 is the subject of this ruling request.\nSection 9(a) of Trust 1 provides that Trustees may distribute the net income of Trust 1 to or for the benefit of Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1\u2019s descendants in such proportions and at such times as Trustees determine is desirable or necessary, considering their needs, best interests, and other sources of income, or may annually accumulate and add all or part of the net income to the principal of Trust 1.\nSection 9(b) of Trust 1 provides that Trustees may distribute the principal of Trust 1 to or for the benefit of Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1\u2019s descendants in such proportions PLR-110419-22 3 and at such times as Trustees determine is desirable or necessary for their medical care, comfortable maintenance, education, or general support and welfare, considering their other resources.\nSection 9(c) of Trust 1 provides that Trust 1 will terminate 21 years after the death of the survivor of Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 2, and the principal of Trust 1 will be distributed to Grandchild 1\u2019s descendants, per stirpes. If, however, Grandchild 1 and Grandchild 1\u2019s descendants all die before that date, Trust 1 will terminate early, and the principal of Trust 1 will be distributed to Trust 2.\nThe purpose of this letter is to describe a trust set up by a grandparent for the benefit of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The trustees may distribute money from the trust, but they must follow certain rules. After 21 years, the trust will end, and the remaining money will be distributed to the main beneficiary's descendants. If all the descendants of the main beneficiary pass away before then, the remaining money will be transferred to another trust.\nThis letter ruling is in response to a request from your authorized representative dated March 11, 2022, and subsequent documentation requesting an extension of an additional five years under Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. Taxpayer represents the facts as follows.\nFACTS\nTaxpayer was incorporated as a State nonprofit corporation. Taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(a) as an organization described in IRC section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under IRC section 509(a). Taxpayer was created by Individuals to support the domestic and international Community and various charitable organizations. Individuals were substantial contributors to Taxpayer within the meaning of IRC section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to Taxpayer under IRC section 4946(a)(1)(A).\nAs a result of Individuals\u2019 death, Taxpayer received A shares of Entity 1 common voting stock from Trust, a disqualified person, on Date 1, which Taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. Additionally, on Date 2, Granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the Individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of Taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from Trust of B shares of Entity 1 common voting stock. Granddaughter is also a disqualified person under IRC section 4946. The combined shares of Taxpayer and Granddaughter represent approximately C percent of Entity 1\u2019s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in Entity 1. As a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the A shares, Taxpayer has excess business holdings of Entity 1 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\nOn Date 3, also as a result of Individuals\u2019 death, Taxpayer received from Trust an approximate Z percent membership interest in Entity 2, an LLC, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. As a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the LLC membership interest, which is a minority interest, Taxpayer has excess business holdings of Entity 2 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\nA nonprofit organization asks for more time to sell extra stocks it received after the deaths of a few key contributors. Nonprofit organizations have a limit on how many stocks they can keep, so they request an extension to get rid of them.\nYou will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. Read it and summarize it. Make sure the summary is short and written in simple words.\nLetter:\nDear [Name],\nThis letter responds to a letter dated March 15, 2022, submitted on behalf of S Corporation Target, Purchaser, and Shareholder (collectively, the \"Parties\"), requesting an extension of time under \u00a7301.9100-3 of the Procedure and Administration Regulations to file an election. The Parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement under \u00a71.336-2(h)(3)(iii) of the Income Tax Regulations (the \"Election Statement\") with respect to Purchaser's acquisition of all the stock of S Corporation Target from Shareholder on Date 1. The material information submitted is summarized below.\nOn Date 1, Purchaser acquired all the stock of S Corporation Target from Shareholder (the \"Stock Disposition\"). It has been represented that the Stock Disposition qualified as a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in \u00a71.336-1(b)(6).\nThe Parties intended to make a section 336(e) election for the Stock Disposition but, for various reasons, a timely election was not fully made. Subsequently, this request was submitted, under \u00a7301.9100-3, for an extension of time to file the Election Statement. The Parties each represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662.\nRegulations promulgated under section 336(e) permit certain sales, exchanges, or distributions of stock of a corporation to be treated as asset dispositions if: (1) the disposition is a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in \u00a71.336-1(b)(6); and (2) a section 336(e) election is made.\nSummary:\nDue to the difficulty of this task, this prompt is not sufficient. By adding another example (\"shot\"), however, we will get much better results. Below you can see the completion:\nA corporation asks the government for more time to file a statement related to its financial performance for a specific tax year. The government has granted the request but may check the information provided by the company later.<br>\n##\nNotes:\nLike in the previous case, you should try several phrasings for your prompt.\nYou can test several options for the prompt in our\nplayground\n.\nAlternatively, you could have summarized for lawyers first, and then simplified the summary (using a different prompt). This method may, however, result in some information being lost.\nSummary\nIn this post, we explore the use-case of summarization.\nIf you need a simple, off-the-shelf summarizer, be sure to check out our specialized\nsummarization API\n.

Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nTutorial\nSummarizing legal documents for different personas using AI21 Studio\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

But when the pandemic hit, they needed to find a low-touch yet incredibly authentic way to connect with the growing number of unemployed youth who were looking to get trained and hired.\nHarambee logo\nSo, how was it done? Harambee not only created a new virtual onboarding process, but also drove a 20% conversion rate increase in sign-ups by using AI21 as their Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine. This was achieved by setting up our Language Models to act as intelligent chatbots. The bots were able to understand the context of each conversation, build rapport with the individuals, and respond naturally \u2013 guiding them toward their career goals.\nWe spoke with Brent Davidoff, who leads Harambee's effort to scale transformative interventions using their omni channel contact center.\nBrent Davidoff, Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator\nWho is Harambee?\nHarambee Youth Employment Accelerator\nis a not-for-profit social enterprise that solves youth employment through partnerships. Harambee works with partners who are also committed to results that can work at scale \u2013 including government, the private sector, civil society, and over three million youth. By fusing brilliant minds with best-in-class technology, Harambee is working to unlock jobs and break down the barriers that keep millions of young South Africans unemployed.\nBut how they bridge the gap between unemployed with no experience to ready to work and employable is a key reason why Harambee eventually needed AI21 Studio.\nHarambee put these youth through a simulation of a workplace that they call the \u201cbridging process\u201d. In it, the individuals report to a manager and are measured on punctuality and soft skills with a scorecard.\n\u201cAfter three months of daily bridging, they were transformed,\u201d said Brent, noting that employers would always see a positive difference in these young adults after completing the program.\nAnd then the 2020 pandemic happened.\nPivoting their processes, and turning to NLP during a pandemic\nThe once highly personalized, streamlined work socialization experience was now at risk. \u201cWith only 120 personnel at the time, we stopped doing face-to-face processes and didn\u2019t do the bridging anymore,\u201d says Brent.\nLike many companies during that time, they went fully remote and launched a new website \u2013\nSAYouth\n. And while they still had companies wanting to employ these youths, these individuals weren\u2019t yet ready for the job market. \u201cThey were missing the secret sauce [of the bridging process],\u201d adds Brent.\nSearching for a Solution that Could Match Human Intelligence\nThis led them to the development of a chatbot that they called \u201cCoachmee\u201d. It created a conversation based learning experience that used evidence-based techniques to effect measurable behavior change in its users. But not without some snags along the way.\n\u201cFrom our previous work with other chatbots [before finding AI21], we had seen how the signup process was a vital component for ensuring high levels of engagement and most chatbots failed to do that with an audience like ours for a number of reasons,\u201d Brent tells us, explaining why he went searching for a new solution.\nHere\u2019s what Harambee needed \u2013 and what led them to AI21.\nProblem #1: A chatbot that can understand, not just repeat\nTheir focus was deeper than simply having quick response times for their customers. Harambee needed help creating trust, rapport, and relationships with their users during their sign-up process \u2013 a critical, pivotal moment in their program.\n\u201cTraditional intent-based NLPs are all about understanding what someone says, but then returning something that is prewritten. But no conversation is like that. You must be unique,\u201d says Brent, providing us with an example of an everyday conversation during the sign-up process.\nChatbot: \u201cWelcome to Coachmee, please tell me your name.\u201d\nPerson: \u201c19547896\u201d\nChatbot: \u201cThat looks like an ID number, would you mind, with respect, telling me your name again?\u201d\nPerson: \u201cMy name is Rejoice Precious Mikateko \u201d\nChatbot: \u201cHello, Rejoice!\u201d\n\u201cAlready there, the ability to see someone and get their name right. \u201cThere\u2019s no traditional intent-based NLP that can do that.\u201d\nProblem #2: Adapt to overcome language barriers and context\nThere are many models that offer a multitude of language options, but one was missing \u2013 what about broken English?\nThere are times when people switch between languages and use a mix of words that would not be understood by a normal chatbot. Our goal isn't just to find something that speaks one of South Africa's 11 official languages, but to find out what someone really is trying to convey.\u201d says Brent.\nWhy AI21 Studio? Better accessibility and support\nWhile we at AI21 have\nbest practices to help mitigate the risk\nof malicious use of language models, AI21\u2019s barrier to entry was non-existent, meaning Harambee could jump right in.\n\u201cI was astonished that there was no huge waiting list to get into this platform and I found the company's vision quite inspiring. I signed up and started playing around on the playground.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to be able to interact with the models, explore presets, and play around before committing to an NLP.\n\u201cI am not a coder,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhen I saw that AI21 Studio had an easy-to-use fine-tuning feature that did not require any previous coding experience, I was excited to see how quickly I could prototype different conversational flows and build something that felt human and relatable.\u201d\nBeyond the Chatbot: How Harambee Used AI21 to Reach Their End Goal\nHarambee saw incredible success using the chatbot.\n\u201cThe conversations [work seekers are having] are incredible,\u201d says Brent. \u201cFor the first time, they feel like they are important. For the first time, they feel like their goals are important. They feel like there is someone there to support them.\u201d\nBeyond building rapport and genuine connection with the South African youth, they were able to utilize AI21 to make their jobs easier and improve further processes.\nSolution #1: Content creation through \u201clifehacks\u201d\nWith AI copywriting, you can automate repetitive writing tasks. Brent and the Harambee team were able to develop around 60 different \"lifehacks\" for users who had signed up for Coachmee check-in sessions.\nLifehacks have to strike a careful balance between being aspirational and transcendent, while being practical and relevant. All within a few sentences, making sure someone doesn't have to scroll back up to read the full message.\nAnother unique contribution of AI21 Labs was around the use of emojis, which enabled the lifehacks to be much more playful and engaging.\nSolution #2: Unique reference letters\nWith the summarization tool, you can compress documents and\nextract key insights into short summaries\n. Brent and the Harambee team used this to create 100% unique, relevant reference letters for each individual who finished their training.\n\u201cSometimes the model can go way too far and make up crazy things about the person,\u201d says Brent, discussing what has gone wrong while using other applications.\n\u201c[But] when a user completes 20 check-ins with Coachmee, we have enough data that can factually testify to someone's commitment to growth and goal-achievement. That information, together with the deep insights into their aspirations and personality that we lifted from the initial sign-up conversation, we are able to use Studio API to generate beautiful reference letters that they can attach to their CVs and take with them to interviews,\u201d explains Brent. \u201cI [once] got a message saying, \u2018I gotta frame this!\u2019\u201d\nReference letter - example\nThe Result: Helping Thousand of Youths Gain Employment When They Need it Most\nHarambee has fine-tuned its AI21 NLP experience to drive meaningful conversations. Their data shows that the stronger the rapport that is built at the beginning of the relationship, the more chance the person has at continuing and completing the process.\nPillar 1 - Engagement: Most start, most finish\nBrent concludes that \u201ccompared to the first iteration of Coachmee which did not use an NLP for the sign-up process, our conversion rate from sign-up to completion has improved by 20%.\u201d\nIn addition, he tells us that almost 1,000 young people have measurably higher prospects of employment thanks to the unique reference letters that AI21 Studio API helped create. \u201cAI21 has been the most generous, collaborative and supportive technology partner that I have ever worked with.\u201d\nWe are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our NLP technology to help elevate the careers of thousands of youths in Africa. We hope this project serves as inspiration to many other organizations around the world.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you!

We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

We hope these will help you kickstart your applications, and even inspire you to come up with ideas for new use cases. For convenience, the examples are grouped into categories, though this grouping doesn\u2019t follow very strict rules. Make sure to check out the last group of\nfun examples\nfor some laughs!\nAll of the examples below use prompts we crafted manually, and they are available in AI21 Studio as presets, so you can try them yourself, tinker with them and use them as a basis for your own prompts.\nPrompt engineering, the process of composing a prompt to perform a specific task, is a fast, easy, and flexible way to build a demo or prototype. In fact, the prompts we\u2019re sharing here are the product of one day's work, at most. To take your application beyond proof-of-concept, we recommend you train a custom model. Custom models in AI21 Studio can be trained on very small datasets with as few as 50-100 examples. They offer better precision and latency and can be more economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. Read our blog post to learn more about bootstrapping your own custom model.\nSummarizing or simplifying text\nJurassic-1 is great at applying different transformations to existing text - consuming some text and then generating a piece of text that relates to it.\nOne common transformation is summarization. Summarization has many business use-cases, such as extracting the gist of online restaurant reviews:\nNote that the model successfully follows the style of the example provided in the prompt, and outputs a sequence of short 2-3 word phrases summarizing the review. In a practical setting, we can imagine this method being used to squeeze reviews for display on small mobile devices.\nAnother useful transformation is simplifying text to make it more readable and accessible. A useful application could be rephrasing a sentence to avoid business jargon:\nOr more explicitly, using Jurassic-1 to explain the meaning of a word in context:\nTry it live in AI21 Studio\nIdeation and copywriting\nJurassic-1 can be used to augment human creativity in content creation, marketing, ecommerce and even creative writing.\nBy priming our model with titles for blog posts about AI and tourism, we can generate plausible ideas for new blog posts about another topic of our choosing:\nHumor and sarcasm are nuanced and notoriously hard for AI models to produce. Nevertheless, it turns out you can feed article topics into the model and get it to generate funny headlines:\nAnother useful application is writing one-sentence product descriptions for marketing and ecommerce. In the following example, Jurassic-1 generates a short description based on a product name and a list of features:\nGenerating code\nJurassic-1 models can process not only English text but also code in a variety of programming languages. We can use this to translate plain English descriptions into correct Python one-liners:\nOr even translate entire functions from one programming language to another:\nWorking with tables\nText often comes in a structured format, like a table. Below are two examples that show how Jurassic-1 can both extract information from a table and generate a properly formatted table from natural language:\nThese two examples highlight the flexibility of Jurassic-1\u2019s universal \u201ctext-in, text-out\u201d interface. The model properly handles various forms of text data out of the box, freeing developers to focus on core functionality instead of worrying about format conversions.\nClassification\nMost use-cases above were generative in nature, meaning they involve generating a phrase, sentence, line of code etc. Another important subset of language tasks are text classification tasks, where the goal is to label a piece of text.\nFor instance, consider topic classification. The following example demonstrates classifying news articles based on their title and their summary:\nNote there are four categories - \u201cWorld\u201d, \u201cSports\u201d, \u201cBusiness\u201d or \u201cScience and Technology\u201d - and we specify them explicitly in the prompt. The model then outputs these as the classification labels.\nWe can use the same idea to perform binary classification. In this example the model determines whether a certain attribute indicates a high or low level of openness (one of the\nBig Five personality traits\nin psychology):\nThis time, the two possible labels (\u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cLow\u201d) aren\u2019t spelled out in the prompt, and the model picks them up from the examples.\nWorld knowledge\nBecause it was trained on a massive amount of text, Jurassic-1 acquired knowledge about different topics. By composing a suitable prompt, we can retrieve facts encoded in the model in natural language form. It\u2019s often a good idea to build a Q&A or \u201cinterview\u201d style prompt for this, like the one we use in the following example to answer sports trivia questions:\nA different kind of knowledge is common sense knowledge. In this example we probe the model\u2019s ability to predict outcomes of different actions according to common sense:\nTry it live in AI21 Studio\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the coverage and accuracy of knowledge encoded in Jurassic-1 may vary depending on factors such as time, topic and geography, and may also reflect bias found in the human-written texts the model was trained on. In particular, don\u2019t expect the model to possess highly domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, note that the model doesn\u2019t have any knowledge of current events, since it was trained on texts dated up to year 2020.\nOther fun examples\nFinally, we\u2019d like to share a few fun examples, built by members of our team on a one-day internal hackathon. These projects were primarily designed to make you laugh, but we hope they also help you imagine the opportunities that AI21 Studio unlocks for media, content creation, human-computer interaction and many other industries.\nJurassic-1 write rap lyrics\nThe team used Jurassic-1 to generate lyrics for rap songs about historical figures. The inspiration is, of course, the musical Hamilton. They primed the model with lyrics about Alexander Hamilton, George Washington (both from \u201cHamilton\u201d) and Eva Per\u00f3n (from \u201cEvita\u201d). Then they had the model generate new lyrics about Barack Obama. Note that they didn\u2019t explicitly provide the model with any of the biographical information about Obama, so all the knowledge (Harvard Law, Michelle, Chicago etc.) is encoded within the model itself. Once they had the lyrics, they packaged them nicely in a video using an off-the-shelf deep fake engine that supports rap, added a beat, et viola.\nJurades: AI charades powered by Jurassic-1\nIn this game, players take turns trying to communicate the identity of random famous characters, without stating their names, following the standard rules of charades. Unlike a normal game of charades, the one responsible for guessing the the characters' identities is not a human, but a language model... Jurassic-1!\nThe model is fed with a few-shot prompt that taps into its world knowledge and text comprehension capabilities. Jurassic-1 is surprsingly good at understanding non-coherent, associative descriptions that humans make under pressure. The prompt is set up to allow the model to self-correct based on failed guesses and follow up hints.\n \nJurassiChess\nContinuing our games theme, JurassiChess uses Jurassic-1 to give you verbal feedback on your chess moves, by integrating it with\nStockfish\n, an open-source chess AI. When you play against Stockfish, it provides a score that represents the strength of your position as well as the AI\u2019s suggestions for the best alternative move (\nin chess notation\n). We feed this information into Jurassic-1 and use specific prompts to generate relevant positive, negative or neutral feedback, resulting in a responsive AI chess tutor experience. And if you don\u2019t mind a little trash-talking, a different set of prompts gives your AI opponent a way to taunt you.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nTutorial\nDiscover use cases for AI21 Studio and Jurassic-1\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

Their goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to create high-performing content, build an audience around their topics of expertise, and monetize opportunities.\nThe Story\nThe founders of\nTweet Hunter\nstarted with an insane challenge: ship one new product every week till you find the one that fits.\n\u201cGenerating revenue from the product was our number one, clear signal for validation.\u201d says Thibault Louis-Lucas, founder of Tweet Hunter.\nThe team started with Twitter as a distribution channel for their products because they had an engaged following of 2,000 people. So they started building a product to help people with a Twitter following generate sales.\nTheir principle was: consistently great content was crucial to a creator\u2019s growth on Twitter.\nBut they needed an LLM partner who could see their vision and fine tune for their specific use-cases.\nWhy AI21? Shared core values, flexibility, and excellence\nTweet Hunter was looking for ways to empower creators to write incredible content faster, by removing gruntwork from the equation. They wanted to create tools that help creators focus on the creative aspects instead of the mundane tasks like editing, collection and formatting. Tweet Hunter's product needs were perfectly aligned with AI21's mission: to help developers build AI-first writing experiences.\nSwitching from the legacy GPT-3, Tweet Hunter found this vision only in AI21.\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve switched back to GPT-3 but we stayed because of the flexibility that AI21 was providing with the fine tuning of models.\u201d says Thibault.\nOne of the bigger differentiator for Tweet Hunter was AI21\u2019s willingness to create a customized pricing plan to sync with Tweet Hunter\u2019s usage and growth. Tweet Hunter saved significantly on customization costs because AI21\u2019s pricing for custom fine-tuned model usage is the same as the foundation model usage. Other LLMs (such as Open AI\u2019s) offer customization at approximately six times the cost of their foundational models.\nWith these criteria coming together perfectly, Tweet Hunter set out to optimize the product to have an 8-figure exit.\nThe first challenge: Generative AI for social media\nSocial media channels have strict specifications such as character limits, use of hashtags, and even tone of voice which makes\neffective\ngenerative AI in social media a challenging task, requiring intense experimentation and refinement.\nInitially, this was a challenge for Tweet Hunter since their primary product offering was designed for Twitter.\nAI21 offered a 3-click custom model training which Tweet Hunter effectively leveraged using their proprietary data to fine-tune a model for the exact capabilities they envisioned. AI21 were flexible with both their approach and features so Tweet Hunter could build a tool with multiple junctions for AI to assist.\nThe second challenge: too many distinct use cases\nWriting engaging tweets presents a multi-level challenge:\nstart with a creative hook, keep it succinct, and build an engaging experience for threads.\nThis means your AI text generator must be adaptable to different use cases. Also, each of these use cases need to integrate seamlessly while being mindful of the user experience.\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s own user interface and algorithm is optimized for engagement and consumption, it's not optimized to inspire you.\nAnd that\u2019s a problem\u201d says Thibault.\nAI21 anticipated diverse use cases and built their large language model to be flexible and adaptable from the onset. As a result, Tweet Hunter could fine tune the model in three clicks, iterate quickly and reach success.\nThe resulting model was built with three distinct capabilities and two sub-capabilities\nThread idea generator\nHook generator\nTweet writer\nSub-capabilities\nTweet extender (expands on the tweet you\u2019re already started writing)\nEach of these features are presented in a fluid transition on the Tweet Hunter platform, which lead to over 5000 paying customers for the tool.\nThe third challenge: unreliable data to train large language models\nTweet Hunter\u2019s founders had tried every method under the sun to consolidate relevant data, from using freelancers to creating spreadsheets themselves.\nNot only was this exercise time intensive but it also produced inconsistent and unreliable results.\nThey were so disappointed after trying out multiple generative AI tools that they switched back to manual data collection. They were worried that poor quality examples would interfere with the very premise of Tweet Hunter: inspiration for great content.\nEnter AI21.\nThe studio\u2019s in-built functionality allowed Tweet Hunter to fine tune the model to learn from a diverse tweet database. AI21's generated suggestions became exponentially better as the system evolved, and Tweet Hunter's goal of helping creators write save-worthy tweets was achieved in a fraction of the time expected.\nAI21\u2019s custom model and proactive engagement throughout the journey was exactly what Tweet Hunter needed in a partner.\n\u201cWe deeply appreciate AI21\u2019s level of involvement with our product and needs in the early days. We were able to evaluate the model\u2019s quality before production and maintain high standards on the quality of tweets.\u201d says Thibault.\nWhat changed for Tweet Hunter after working with AI21?\nIn the last two years, Thibault\u2019s personal account grew from 2,000 followers to 60,000 followers. With Tweet Hunter's scheduling feature and tweet generation tools powered by Ai21\u2019s language models, he (and other users) could tweet frequently and effectively.\nTweet Hunter scaled to 1M ARR and an 8-figure exit in under a year.\n\u201cThe content is very high quality. The tool works with diverse creators, varied niches, and complex topics. So most of the growth comes from the fact that our users are actually successful with the tool.\u201d says\nThibault\n.\nThe level of personalization possible with AI21 propelled Tweet Hunter to first place for multiple creators.\nhttps://twitter.com/mvxlondon/status/1621192750900051971\n\u201cPersonalized, highly viral tweet formats developed with AI21 helped busy users share valuable content. That was the win. Our tool became 10 times faster with the AI integration.\u201d says Thibault.\nThe road forward\nWith lempire\u2019s acquisition of Tweet Hunter, the road forward is fast-paced and fascinating.\nThe team plans to introduce new features to the platform based on public feedback. AI21 is also set to be integrated with other products in lempire\u2019s toolkit: personalized cold emails, automated follow-ups, and engagement with leads across multiple channels.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you!

On your platform, hotel visitors can leave written reviews and an overall star rating for the hotel. These reviews allow hotel owners to gain a general understanding of guest satisfaction through their overall score, but that\u2019s just one part of the story. The quality of the hotel experience is a combination of many factors, including the room quality, the facilities, and the staff. Ideally, the owner would like to get a clear picture of their hotel\u2019s strengths and weaknesses so they can improve on the aspects that are lacking and highlight the aspects that visitors find positive.\nTo extract these insights, some hotel owners sit down from time to time and read all of the reviews that were written about their hotel. This is a tedious task - one you, as a developer, would probably want to spare your users from. What if you could create a dashboard that highlights the areas guests mention positively or negatively in their reviews? As a result, your user - in this case, the hotel owner - can get a real-time snapshot of their strengths and weaknesses with just a glance at this dashboard.\nNot so long ago, you would have needed to work pretty hard to create a solution like that (for example,\nusing several classical methods\n). But with large language models (LLMs), it\u2019s really easy. You can perform this analysis with high accuracy, even with no prior knowledge of natural language processing (NLP). If that sounds appealing to you, then read on. By the end of this post, you will be able to implement this feature in your platform or product.\nThis post will walk you through the process of building an NLP-powered dashboard for a hotel, including:\nUsing an external API to gather real-world data.\nPerforming freeform combined topic extraction and sentiment analysis using Jurassic-1, part of the AI21 Studio suite of large language models.\nGenerating the output in a convenient format (JSON) so it\u2019s easier to process.\nIf you are new to large language models, we recommend first reading\nStep 1: Collect reviews using an external API\nYou can find the Hotels.com API on\nRapidAPI\n. There are several endpoints to this API. We need the\nendpoint, that returns the reviews for a given hotel, page-by-page. There are approximately 50 reviews per page. In order to retrieve all of the available reviews we will call the API while iterating through the pages. The following functions do just that:\ndef get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number):\n    params = {\n        \"locale\": \"en_US\", \n        \"hotel_id\": hotel_id, \n        \"page_number\": str(page_number)\n    }\n    headers = {\n        \"X-RapidAPI-Key\": RAPID_API_KEY,\n        \"X-RapidAPI-Host\": \"hotels-com-provider.p.rapidapi.com\"\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url=GET_REVIEWS_URL, headers=headers, params=params)\n     \n    reviews = [\n        review['summary'] \n        for page_reviews in response.json()['groupReview']\n        for review in page_reviews['reviews']\n    ]\n    return reviews\n\n\ndef get_hotel_reviews(hotel_id, num_pages):\n    all_reviews = sum(\n        [get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number) for page_number in range(1, num_pages + 1)],\n        start=[]\n    )\n    return all_reviews\nNote that running this function requires an API key for the\nreviews\nendpoint, which you can obtain from RapidAPI. This is not your AI21 Studio API key. There are some edge cases that this function doesn\u2019t cover, such as requesting a page number that doesn\u2019t exist, but we\u2019ll set them aside for the purposes of this blog post.\nThroughout this process, we will use the\nEmpire Hotel in New York\nas a running example. You can use an API endpoint to get the hotel ID, or you can find it in the hotel\u2019s URL on Hotels.com:\nStep 2: Prepare the reviews data for the language model\nLarge language models are very powerful and can ingest text of all shapes and sizes, but as the old saying goes, \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d. If you feed the model a bad prompt, the results will be far from optimal.\nIn this case, you should keep the following points in mind:\nReviews that are too short could be problematic since they often do not contain enough information to extract any meaningful insights.\nCurrently, our models are limited to the English language only.\nIn order to remove reviews that are too short or not in English, you can apply some simple filters to all of the reviews:\nfrom langdetect import detect\ndef filter_reviews(reviews):\n    en_reviews = [review for review in reviews if len(review)>=20 and detect(review)==\"en\"]\n            \n    return en_reviews\nNote: Here, we have removed reviews that have no real content by applying a very basic filter. Although this is not mandatory, we recommend that you pre-process your reviews by, for example, removing weird characters and extra spaces, etc.\nStep 3: Extract the categories and sentiments using AI21 Studio\nThis step is where you truly  harness the power of AI21 Studio\u2019s large language models!\nYou want the model to extract the topics and sentiments of each free text review into a structured JSON format. You can do this by leveraging a main strength of language models: when provided with text in plain English, the language model can identify patterns and generate text that follows the same pattern. By feeding the model a prompt with a few examples (this is called a\n), it can identify the pattern and generate a reasonably good completion.\nObtaining these examples, however, requires you to manually go through several reviews, which we have done below. The resulting few-shot prompt is as follows (the reviews are as written by the platform\u2019s users, with no grammar or spelling corrections):\nGreat experience for two teenagers. We would book again. Location good.\n{\"Location\": \"Positive\"}\nExtremely old cabinets, phone was half broken and full of dust. Bathroom door was broken, bathroom floor was dirty and yellow. Bathroom tiles were falling off. Asked to change my room and the next room was in the same conditions.\nThe most out of date and least maintained hotel i ever been on.\n{\"Cleaning\": \"Negative\", \"Hotel Facilities\": \"Negative\", \"Room Quality\": \"Negative\"}\nReview:\nRoof top\u2019s view is gorgeous and the lounge area is comfortable. The staff is very courteous and the location is great. The hotel is outdated and the shower need to be clean better. The air condition runs all the time and cannot be control by the temperature control setting.\nExtracted sentiment:\n{\"Cleaning\": \"Negative\", \"AC\": \"Negative\", \"Room Quality\": \"Negative\", \"Service\": \"Positive\", \"View\": \"Positive\", \"Hotel Facilities\": \"Positive\"}\n##\nCreating a good prompt is more than simply deciding on the pattern. The goal is to construct a prompt that triggers the model to generate the optimal completion (this is called\nprompt engineering\n). To achieve this, you should keep the following in mind:\nVariety:\nthe examples in the prompt will determine the model\u2019s responses for unseen data, so they must be diverse enough to reflect the real-world distribution. This applies to both the structure of the reviews (such as length) and the content (the topics discussed in every review, the sentiments, etc.). Be sure to include reviews that are mixed in sentiment (like the third example provided above), as these are usually harder to analyze.\nAmount:\nhow \u201cfew\u201d examples should our\nfew-shot prompt\ninclude? When it comes to this relatively complex task, it is recommended that you provide at least eight different examples in the prompt (depending on the number of topics and the variety within them). The most effective way to determine this is through testing it out in the playground.\nTry it yourself!\nAdditionally, in this use-case, we recommend setting the temperature to 0, as high accuracy is required more than creativity. Increasing the temperature will result in more creative results, while lowering the temperature will increase their accuracy. Curious about temperature? See Step 4 in\nthis post\nfor more detail on this.\nHappy with the prompt and want to start analyzing reviews? You can copy the few-shot prompt from the playground:\nAnd use the following function to create the prompt for every review:\ndef create_review_prompt(review):\n    few_shot_examples = FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES\n    prompt = few_shot_examples + review + \"\\nExtracted sentiment:\\n\"\n    return prompt\nFor every review, create the prompt and then call Jurassic-1 to perform the analysis (you can take the call from the playground, as illustrated above, or use the function from\n).\nStep 4: Create the dashboard\nOnce you have the list of topics and sentiments, you can create your dashboard.\nFirst, gather all of the topics together, assigning a count of \"Positive\" or \"Negative\" to each topic. Since you already have the completion in JSON format, you can process it using standard packages. However, as the format may not be perfect, and you don\u2019t want any failures in your automated process, you can add a simple try-catch block. This means if a completion from the model isn\u2019t in perfect JSON format, you drop it. You can use the following function:\ndef get_topK_categories_and_score(sentiments, k=7):\n    parsed_sentiments = []\n    for sentiment in sentiments:\n      try:\n         parsed_sentiments.append(ast.literal_eval(sentiment))\n      except SyntaxError:\n        pass\n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame(parsed_sentiments)\n\n    # extract the K categories with the most reviews    \n    keys = df.count().sort_values(ascending=False)[:k].index.tolist()\n    \n    category_names = ['Negative', 'Positive']\n    scores = {}\n\n    for key in keys:\n        scores[key] = [(df[key] == category_names[0]).sum(), (df[key] == category_names[1]).sum()]\n        \n    return scores, category_names\nAt this stage, all that\u2019s left to do is create the figure. With minor changes to this\nmatplotlib\nexample, you\u2019ll have your dashboard:\nYou can see that the hotel is deemed excellent in Location and rather good in Service and Cleaning. However, it should invest more in the WiFi and AC, and perhaps do some renovations or upgrades to the rooms and facilities.\nAs a last step and some sanity check, you\u2019ll probably want to validate your results, but without manually reading every review. One way to do that is to compare them with those of other hotel platforms, such as Booking.com. If you go to the\nBooking.com page for this hotel\n, where visitors are asked to rate hotels across numerous categories, you will find the overall picture is very similar to your own analysis:\nSummary\nBy following the steps laid out in this post, you have built a very useful feature that can be implemented on hotel and accommodation platforms. Thanks to large language models, analyzing pieces of text, such as reviews, has never been easier. A few simple tweaks, such as writing the examples in JSON format, can save a lot of time in post-processing, making the entire process faster and easier. You can find the full notebook in our\ndev-hub\nAre you interested in building your own feature? With a custom model, you\u2019ll  always get the highest quality results. You can find out more about that\nhere\n.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nYuval Belfer\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you!

We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X.

The future of human-machine interaction is full of possibility and promise, but any powerful technology needs careful deployment. The joint statement below represents a step towards building a community to address the global challenges presented by AI progress, and we encourage other organizations who would like to participate to get in touch.\nJoint Recommendation for Language Model Deployment\nWe\u2019re recommending several key principles to help providers of large language models (LLMs) mitigate the risks of this technology in order to achieve its full promise to augment human capabilities.\nWhile these principles were developed specifically based on our experience with providing LLMs through an API, we hope they will be useful regardless of release strategy (such as open-sourcing or use within a company). We expect these recommendations to change significantly over time because the commercial uses of LLMs and accompanying safety considerations are new and evolving. We are actively learning about and addressing LLM limitations and avenues for misuse, and will update these principles and practices in collaboration with the broader community over time.\nWe\u2019re sharing these principles in hopes that other LLM providers may learn from and adopt them, and to advance public discussion on LLM development and deployment.\nProhibit misuse\nPublish usage guidelines and terms of use\nof LLMs in a way that prohibits material harm to individuals, communities, and society such as through spam, fraud, or astroturfing. Usage guidelines should also specify domains where LLM use requires extra scrutiny and prohibit high-risk use-cases that aren\u2019t appropriate, such as classifying people based on protected characteristics.\nBuild systems and infrastructure to enforce usage guidelines\n. This may include rate limits, content filtering, application approval prior to production access, monitoring for anomalous activity, and other mitigations.\nMitigate unintentional harm\nProactively mitigate harmful model behavior\n. Best practices include comprehensive model evaluation to properly assess limitations, minimizing potential sources of bias in training corpora, and techniques to minimize unsafe behavior such as through learning from human feedback.\nDocument known weaknesses and vulnerabilities\n, such as bias or ability to produce insecure code, as in some cases no degree of preventative action can completely eliminate the potential for unintended harm. Documentation should also include model and use-case-specific safety best practices.\nThoughtfully collaborate with stakeholders\nBuild teams with diverse backgrounds\nand solicit broad input. Diverse perspectives are needed to characterize and address how language models will operate in the diversity of the real world, where if unchecked they may reinforce biases or fail to work for some groups.\nPublicly disclose lessons learned regarding LLM safety and misuse\nin order to enable widespread adoption and help with cross-industry iteration on best practices.\nTreat all labor in the language model supply chain with respect\n. For example, providers should have high standards for the working conditions of those reviewing model outputs in-house and hold vendors to well-specified standards (e.g. ensuring labelers are able to opt out of a given task).\nAs LLM providers, publishing these principles represents a first step in collaboratively guiding safer large language model development and deployment. We are excited to continue working with each other and with other parties to identify other opportunities to reduce unintentional harms from and prevent malicious use of language models.\nSupport from other organizations\n\u201cWhile LLMs hold a lot of promise, they have significant inherent safety issues which need to be worked on. These best practices serve as an important step in minimizing the harms of these models and maximizing their potential benefits.\u201d - Anthropic\n\u201cAs large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and expressive, risk mitigation becomes increasingly important. We welcome these and other efforts to proactively seek to mitigate harms and highlight to users areas requiring extra diligence. The principles outlined here are an important contribution to the global conversation.\u201d \u2013 John Bansemer, Director of the CyberAI Project and Senior Fellow, Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET)\n\"Google affirms the importance of comprehensive strategies in analyzing model and training data to mitigate the risks of harm, bias, and misrepresentation.

We welcome this and other efforts that drive thoughtful and practical action across the industry, learning from and working with key stakeholders in academia, civil society, and government.\" \u2014 Microsoft\n\u201cThe safety of foundation models, such as large language models, is a growing social concern.  We commend Cohere, OpenAI, and AI21 Labs for taking a first step to outline high-level principles for responsible development and deployment from the perspective of model developers.  There is still much work to be done, and we believe it is essential to engage more voices from academia, industry, and civil society to develop more detailed principles and community norms.

Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nTutorial\nBest practices for deploying language models\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

We use a simple text classification use-case as our guiding example, but the same process can be applied to a wide variety of language tasks.\nWe start by introducing the task and implementing a baseline solution using prompt engineering with Jurassic-1. Although prompt engineering is a quick and straightforward method for building a proof-of-concept, it has some key limitations, which we highlight in detail below.\nTo address these limitations, we implement a better solution by training a\ncustom model\nspecifically for our example task. AI21 Studio\u2019s custom models are tailored for optimal performance on a given task and can be economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. Even more importantly, custom models are easy to set up and use!\nCustom models in AI21 Studio require remarkably little data for training\n; most tasks can be addressed successfully by training a model on as few as 50-100 examples. This dramatically lowers the entry barrier for training a state-of-the-art language model of your own, to power your app with excellent quality results. Your trained custom model is served in AI21 Studio and it is immediately available for use, making integration in your application as easy as performing an API query.\nOur Example Task: Classifying News Article Topics\nAs a guiding example throughout this blogpost, we will use a well known Natural Language Processing (NLP) task: classifying the topics of news articles. Specifically, we follow the AG News task formulation, where articles are classified based on their title and their summary into one of four categories: \u201cWorld\u201d, \u201cSports\u201d, \u201cBusiness\u201d or \u201cScience and Technology\u201d. For example, consider the following sample of three examples from the AG News training set:\nExamples of news article titles and summaries from the AG News training set, first introduced by\nZhang et al (2015)\nand available online\nhere\nThe correct labels for examples 1-3 above are \u201cBusiness\u201d, \u201cSports\u201d and \u201cWorld\u201d, respectively.\nPrompt Engineering Solution\nJurassic-1 language models are trained to predict likely continuations for a piece of input text, called a \u201cprompt\u201d. We will use this ability to our advantage, by feeding the model with manually crafted prompts that give rise to a specific behavior in the model output; in our case, we\u2019d like the model to output correct labels for articles. The practice of composing a suitable prompt for a specific task is commonly referred to as\n\u201cprompt engineering\u201d\nA common and effective prompt engineering approach is to construct a prompt containing a sequence of correctly labeled examples, often called a\n\u201cfew-shot prompt\u201d\n. The goal of a few-shot prompt is to cause the model to latch on to the correct relation between inputs (for our task - title and summary) and outputs (topic label).\nWe built a few-shot prompt for our use-case according to best practices, as described in detail in the\n. We measured the accuracy of predictions on the AG News test set, while varying the number of examples in the prompt. The results are reported in the table below. Note that as we increase the number of examples, the models tend to perform better. This is typically the case with few-shot prompts. Using J1-Jumbo, we reach a respectable accuracy of 86% for a 16-example prompt.\nAG News test set accuracy for Jurassic-1 models using prompt engineering while varying the number of examples in the prompt.\nWhy go beyond Prompt Engineering?\nWe were able to get impressive performance on our task with a very simple method and a tiny dataset of 16 examples (4 per class). This is excellent, but there are several reasons not to be content with our prompt engineering-based solution.\nFirst and most obvious, few-shot prompts can become rather long as the number of examples is increased. This means that on each new prediction the model must read and process the entire prompt, increasing the compute time and resulting in\nhigher latency, energy consumption and cost per prediction.\nSince adding examples to the prompt improves accuracy considerably, we are left with an inconvenient tradeoff between quality and cost, making it challenging to serve production-scale traffic with prompt engineering-based solutions.\nFurthermore, language models have a maximum allowed input length. Jurassic-1 models can handle up to 2048 tokens (or roughly 2300-2500 English words), counting both the prompt and the generated text. Although impressive, this might not be enough in many cases. Imagine if instead of using a short summary of an article, we wanted to use the full article body as the input to our topic classification task. In such a case it would be hard to fit more than 1 or 2 examples into the prompt, so we wouldn\u2019t have even one example per topic (recall we want to distinguish between 4 topics). Alternatively, had we needed to categorize article summaries into one of 100 potential topics, we would have had a similar problem.\nEven if we make the most out of prompt engineering, we may require even better accuracy. Suppose we wanted to break the 90% barrier; judging by our results so far, this might be a tall order for prompt engineering.\nFinally, we note that custom models have safety advantages. Since they are trained to perform a particular task, it is harder for a malicious user to abuse access to a custom model. We give an example of this in the\nIn the next section we introduce\ncustom models\nas a more precise, scalable and cost-effective alternative to prompt engineering, which allows us to overcome the limitations described above.\nCustom Model Solution\nCustom models are specialized versions of the general purpose models which we have been using so far, trained to deliver optimal results on a given task. By combining our powerful Jurassic-1 language models with our special training techniques, AI21 Studio allows you to train a capable model using only a small amount of data, and makes it very easy to query your model once it\u2019s trained.\nTo train a custom model of your own, all you need to do is provide us with a small dataset of correctly solved examples, and we will do the rest.\nThe quality of results you get from a custom model depends on the amount and the quality of training data you provide. As a starting point for most tasks, we recommend using 50-100 examples, since we find this is often enough to achieve great results. So, if you can get your hands on a few dozen examples, we recommend you try our custom models. Even if you don\u2019t have data at all, we have a few tricks you can use - see the\nAppendix\nfor more details.\nTo pick up where we left our topic classification case study, we trained custom models for AG News while varying the number of examples in the training set. The resulting accuracy on the AG News test set is shown in the table below. As you can see, with as few as 10 examples our custom model\u2019s accuracy is comparable to J1-Large with a few-shot prompt. We also see that adding more training examples results in better accuracy for our custom model, surpassing J1-Jumbo\u2019s few-shot performance with only 80 training examples.\nAG News test set accuracy for custom Jurassic-1 models trained on datasets varying in size.\nCustom models really start to shine when we take\nlatency\ninto consideration. Feeding the general purpose J1-Jumbo model with an engineered prompt consisting of 16 examples, we got an accuracy of 86%, and the typical processing time in this case is ~250 milliseconds. A custom model that matches or exceeds this accuracy only needs to process the summary and title of the individual example we\u2019re labeling; there is no need to include a lengthy prompt in every request, because the task-specific behavior is already baked into the model. As a consequence, our custom model can process a typical request in less than 50 milliseconds, offering a\ngreater than 5x speedup\ncompared to prompt engineering\n.\nAppendix: Engineering the Prompt\nAn easy way to start engineering a prompt is to feed the model with simple instructions for the required task, such as the following:\nTo predict the label for a given article, we could input the text above followed by the article title, its summary, and a heading that prompts the model to output the correct label as a completion. The full prompt using this scheme follows below.\nWe can replace the text highlighted in blue with the relevant title and summary for any inference example we\u2019d like to label and let the model generate a continuation after \u201cThe topic of this article is:\u201d. This is commonly referred to as a\n\u201czero-shot prompt\u201d\n, because the model is expected to correctly perform the task without feeding it any correctly solved example. Using the prompt above, J1-Large has an accuracy of 32% and J1-Jumbo gets 56.9% on the AG News test set; although significantly better than a random guess accuracy, this leaves much to be desired.\nThe zero-shot approach can be improved upon by adding a number of correctly labeled examples to the prompt itself, making it a \u201c\nfew-shot prompt\u201d\n. Jurassic-1 models recognize and imitate patterns in text, so including a few solved examples in the prompt helps reinforce the desired relation between inputs (title and summary) and outputs (topic label); this usually improves prediction accuracy. A few-shot prompt using the sample of three articles above is shown below. As in the zero-shot case, it will end with the inference example specified in the same uniform format, so the text highlighted in blue will be replaced with the appropriate content for the inference example.\nOnce we\u2019ve decided on a prompt format as above, we can simply make a longer prompt by adding more examples in the same format. There are some considerations we should keep in mind while doing this:\nKeep the examples relatively balanced between the classes (i.e. the 4 possible topics), to avoid biasing the model towards the more common classes in the prompt.\nScramble the order of the examples to avoid the model latching on to the wrong pattern (e.g. \u201cBusiness\u201d always comes after \u201cWorld\u201d in the examples).\nMake sure there\u2019s enough room for the example you actually want to predict. Jurassic-1 models are restricted to 2048 tokens, which should include the prompt and the generated output (1-2 tokens in our case).\nWe built a prompt corresponding to these guidelines. The resulting accuracy for varying prompt lengths is reported above. Not surprisingly, the best results are achieved with J1-Jumbo and the longest (16-example) prompt, reaching an accuracy 86% on the AG News test set.\nAppendix: Safety Advantages of Custom Models\nAI21 Labs is committed to promoting safety in our products. One potential safety risk is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to Jurassic-1 to generate text for their malicious purposes. Adversaries may attempt to achieve this via\n\u201cprompt injection\u201d\n, where the end-user\u2019s input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. As we will now demonstrate, custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general-purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production.\nConsider a malicious user who has access to the news article topic classification system built on top of Jurassic-1 and wishes to abuse it to extract toxic generations from the model. Recall that an engineered prompt for topic classification ends with the following text:\nWhere <TITLE> and <SUMMARY> are user inputs. A malicious user may attempt a prompt injection attack by providing the adversarial input \u201cThe topic of this article is:\u201d followed by some offensive text in place of a legitimate summary, hoping that the model will generate the offensive text or something related to it as the completion. Since language models latch on to patterns, the malicious user may even repeat this input line a few times to increase their chances of success. For example, below the adversarial input is repeated 3 times:\nThe figures below compare the performance of the solutions described in this blog post - prompt engineering versus custom models - when faced with an attack like this. We see that the outcome depends on the number of repetitions of the toxic text in the input. For prompt engineering, if the adversary introduces 2 or more repetitions of the toxic text, 50% of the model outputs are toxic, and 3 or more repetitions cause the model to exclusively generate toxic outputs. For custom models, it takes 4 or more repetitions for the adversary to successfully extract toxic generations from the model, and even then the probability of a toxic output is much lower than for prompt engineering.\nPercentage of examples in the AG News test set for which a prompt injection attack successfully generates toxic outputs.\nLeft\n- prompt engineering-based solution with a 16-example prompt.\nRight\n- custom model solution trained on 3200 examples. The horizontal axis shows the number of times the toxic text (shown above) was repeated in the adversarial input. Greedy decoding (temperature=0) was used for generating from both models\nAlthough using a custom model doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk entirely in this example, it does decrease it substantially, in a way that makes other safety mechanisms more effective. For example, to protect against prompt injection in a news topic classification system, it makes sense to limit the amount of text a user can input in the summary field. Any safety measure creates a tradeoff between restricting usage and guaranteeing safety, which in this case is found in the maximum allowed input length: set the threshold too high and prompt injection attacks will be more likely to succeed; set the threshold too low and legitimate inputs will be blocked. Using a custom model, which is less susceptible to prompt injection out of the box, makes the tradeoff easier and allows a developer to choose a higher threshold while guaranteeing the same level of safety.\nAppendix: No data? No problem!\nJurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. Nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting\nany\nlabeled data? As we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible.\nFirst, we note two simple observations:\nA prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy.\nThe model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its \u201cconfidence\u201d in the label. High-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions.\nRelying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach:\nCollect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification.\nUse a prompt engineering-based solution to automatically label them with J1-Jumbo.\nFilter the auto-labeled examples by confidence, resulting in a dataset of examples where the model assigns >85% probability to the labels it predicted. Make sure the different classes are equally represented in the dataset.\nTrain a custom model on the high-confidence auto-labeled dataset.\nThe table below shows the test set accuracy of custom models trained using this approach. We varied the number of labeled examples in the few-shot prompt, and used it to auto-label 160 examples for training. With just 4 labeled examples (1 per class), we beat J1-Jumbo\u2019s accuracy with an engineered prompt containing 8 labeled examples. Using 16 labeled examples (4 per class) to auto-label a 160-example dataset, we not only beat J1-Jumbo but also match the performance of a custom model trained on 160\nmanually\nlabeled examples (88.5%).\nAG News test set accuracy for custom Jurassic-1 models trained on 160 auto-labeled examples, while varying the number of manually labeled examples in the few-shot prompt used for auto-labeling. Accuracy of J1-Jumbo with a few-shot prompt utilizing the same amount of labeled data is shown for comparison.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nTutorial\nZero-to-production: bootstrapping a custom model in AI21 Studio\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

This API is designed to avoid any factual issues that may arise when using language models to provide answers. It receives document text and a question and returns an answer based solely on the provided context. This means that if the answer to a question is not in the document, the model will indicate this rather than providing a potentially inaccurate answer. As a task-specific API, it is optimized for efficiency and can be easily integrated into existing systems without requiring any prompt engineering. Overall, the Contextual Answers API provides a user-friendly and efficient solution for accurate and context-based question answering.\nThe Contextual Answers API requires two parameters for a successful request:\ncontext\n: A string containing the document context for which the question will be answered.\nquestion\n: A string containing the question to be answered based on the provided context.\nThe Contextual Answers API returns the following parameter in its response:\nanswer\n: A string containing the answer to the question based on the provided context. The answer will be null if the model cannot find an answer in the provided context.\nid\n: A unique identifier assigned by the API to identify the specific request that generated the response. This parameter can be useful for tracking and logging purposes, particularly if multiple requests are being made to the API.\nPython\npayload = {\n    \"context\": \"In 2020 and 2021, enormous QE \u2014 approximately $4.4 trillion, or 18%, of 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 and enormous fiscal stimulus (which has been and always will be inflationary) \u2014 approximately $5 trillion, or 21%, of 2021 GDP \u2014 stabilized markets and allowed companies to raise enormous amounts of capital. In addition, this infusion of capital saved many small businesses and put more than $2.5 trillion in the hands of consumers and almost $1 trillion into state and local coffers. These actions led to a rapid decline in unemployment, dropping from 15% to under 4% in 20 months \u2014 the magnitude and speed of which were both unprecedented. Additionally, the economy grew 7% in 2021 despite the arrival of the Delta and Omicron variants and the global supply chain shortages, which were largely fueled by the dramatic upswing in consumer spending and the shift in that spend from services to goods. Fortunately, during these two years, vaccines for COVID-19 were also rapidly developed and distributed.In today's economy, the consumer is in excellent financial shape (on average), with leverage among the lowest on record, excellent mortgage underwriting (even though we've had home price appreciation), plentiful jobs with wage increases and more than $2 trillion in excess savings, mostly due to government stimulus. Most consumers and companies (and states) are still flush with the money generated in 2020 and 2021, with consumer spending over the last several months 12% above pre-COVID-19 levels. (But we must recognize that the account balances in lower-income households, smaller to begin with, are going down faster and that income for those households is not keeping pace with rising inflation.) Today's economic landscape is completely different from the 2008 financial crisis when the consumer was extraordinarily overleveraged, as was the financial system as a whole \u2014 from banks and investment banks to shadow banks, hedge funds, private equity, Fan\n...Text Truncated...\n\nThe following is a possible response from the Contextual Answers API to the example request above:\nJSON\n{\n  \"id\": \"36d2ec63-ef15-2296-af51-ef34206fc655\",\n  \"answer\": \"The Delta and Omicron variants and the global supply chain shortages did not slow down economic growth.\"\n}\nTable of Contents\nRequest Parameters\nResponse Parameters\nExample", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/reference/contextual-answers-api-ref"}, {"title": "Contextual Answers", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nJUMP TO\nJurassic-2\nJ2 Complete API\nJ2 Complete\nJ2 Instruct API\nJ2 Instruct\nCustom J-2 Models\nDatasets API\nAdd Dataset\nGet Datasets List\nGet Dataset\nDelete Dataset\ndelete\nCustom Models API\nCustom Model Training\nGet Custom Models List\nGet Custom Model\nget\nCustom Model Complete\nUpdate Default Epoch\nput\nTask-Specific APIs\nParaphrase API\nParaphrase\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nGrammatical Error Corrections\nText Improvements API\nText Improvements\nSummarize API\nSummarize\nText Segmentation API\nText Segmentation\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nSDK\nPython SDK\nJurassic-1 [Legacy]\nJ-1 Complete API\nJ-1 Complete\nJ-1 Grande Instruct [beta]\nOther\nTokenize API\nTokenize\nContextual Answers\npost\nhttps://api.ai21.com\n/studio/v1/experimental/answer\nLanguage\nShell\nNode\nRuby\nPHP\nPython\nAuthentication\nHeader\nLog in to use your API keys\nRESPONSE\nClick\nTry It!\nto start a request and see the response here!", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/reference/contextual-answers-ref"}, {"title": "J-1 Complete", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nJUMP TO\nJurassic-2\nJ2 Complete API\nJ2 Complete\nJ2 Instruct API\nJ2 Instruct\nCustom J-2 Models\nDatasets API\nAdd Dataset\nGet Datasets List\nGet Dataset\nDelete Dataset\ndelete\nCustom Models API\nCustom Model Training\nGet Custom Models List\nGet Custom Model\nget\nCustom Model Complete\nUpdate Default Epoch\nput\nTask-Specific APIs\nParaphrase API\nParaphrase\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nGrammatical Error Corrections\nText Improvements API\nText Improvements\nSummarize API\nSummarize\nText Segmentation API\nText Segmentation\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nContextual Answers\nSDK\nPython SDK\nJurassic-1 [Legacy]\nJ-1 Complete API\nJ-1 Grande Instruct [beta]\nOther\nTokenize API\nTokenize\nJ-1 Complete\npost\nhttps://api.ai21.com\n/studio/v1/j1-\n{model_type}\n/complete\n\ud83e\udd16 Generate text using Complete API\nSet up\nTo install the SDK, run the following command:\nTerminal\n$ pip install -U ai21\nAPI Keys\nYou can find your API key\nAPI keys can be set globally using ai21.api_key, like so:\nimport ai21\nai21.api_key = <YOUR_API_KEY>\nBuild a prompt\nWe recommend following our\nPrompt Engineering\nbest practices for optimal results.\nYou can try \"Zero Shot\" prompt:\nprompt = \"These are a few of my favorite\"\nOr, \"Few Shot\" prompt:\nprompt = \"\"\"\nComplete the following sentence.\nSentence: These are a few of my favorite\nCompletion: things.

It has been fine-tuned specifically for paraphrasing. As a result, it's easier to integrate into your systems, and since it's optimized for this purpose, it's also more efficient (and therefore cheaper) than building it from scratch. This is also the engine behind\nWordtune\n- so you know it's pretty awesome.\nThis API takes a piece of\ntext\nand returns a list of paraphrases that convey the same meaning using different words. As a specialized API for paraphrasing, it contains features to enable you more control over the output: adjust the tone and style, with the choice of rewriting only parts of a text (while keeping the whole context).\nThis API will return a list of up to 10 suggested paraphrases with every request.\nPython\n\"style\": \"general\",\n    \"text\": \"You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.\"\nFor example, here's a possible response for the request above:\nJSON\n{\n  \"id\": \"862829b2-29be-c86d-370e-db2f7f5dbf5b\",\n  \"suggestions\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"One life is enough if you live it right.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"When you do it right, you only live once.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Once is all you have, but if you do it right, once is enough.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"When you live right, you only need to live once.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"One life is enough if you live it right, but if you don't do it right, one life is not enough.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The only chance you have to live is once, but if you live well, a once is enough.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The only way to live is right, so if you do it right, once is enough.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Once is enough if you live it right, but if you do it wrong, you'll regret it later.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In life, you only live once, but if you do it right, once should be plenty.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"It takes only one life to live a fulfilling life, but if you do it right, one life is enough.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nYou have the choice between 4 different styles:\ngeneral\n- explore fresh new ways to rephrase your sentences.\ncasual\n- convey a lighter and less serious tone for the right audience.\nformal\n- present your words in a more professional way.\nlong\n- expand your sentences to give more detail, nuance and depth.\nshort\n- stick to word limits and convey your messages clearly and concisely.\nYou can paraphrase a specific span within the given text while keeping the surrounding text unchanged by specifying locations, using the\nstartIndex\nand\nendIndex\nparameters.

Our approach supplements the original pre-trained model with an auxiliary model that shifts the output distribution according to the target task.\nWhy it matters\nAchieving state-of-the-art fluency in language tasks such as text generation entails\ncostly training of large LMs\n. Auxiliary Tuning allows practitioners to amortize this cost across target tasks by leveraging existing pre-trained LMs. This is done without modifying the pre-trained weights, avoiding the risks of rigidity and catastrophic forgetting, and allowing natural scaling to multiple target tasks.\nHow it works\nThe auxiliary model is trained by adding its logits to the pre-trained model logits and maximizing the likelihood of the target task output. Our method imposes no constraints on the auxiliary architecture. In particular, the auxiliary model can ingest additional input relevant to the target task, independently from the pre-trained model\u2019s input. Furthermore, mixing the models at the logits level provides a natural probabilistic interpretation of the method.\nResults\nWe tested Auxiliary Tuning on a number of different conditional text generation tasks. Adapting a pre-trained LM using our method resulted in similar performance to training a comparable model on the target task from scratch, while using significantly less compute for training.  Below we present results for a text generation task conditioned on keywords, where the generated text has to include the keyword provided to the model. We show that our method achieves similar accuracy (the fraction of samples that contain the keyword that we conditioned on) compared to a naive autoregressive Transformers baseline. Interestingly, our method generates fluent samples early in training, demonstrating its effectiveness of harnessing the fluency of the pre-trained model (as measured by\nSLOR\n).\nRelated methods\nAuxiliary Tuning is related to, but different from, fine-tuning,\nfew-shot learning, Plug-and-Play Language Model (PPLM)\nand\nside-tuning\n.

Our model, SenseBERT, achieves significantly improved lexical disambiguation abilities, setting state-of-the-art results on the Word in Context (WiC) task.\nRead the paper\nPresented at ACL 2020\nSelf-supervision for Pre-trained Language Models\nThe use of self-supervision has allowed neural language models to advance the frontier in Natural Language Understanding. Specifically, the self-supervision strategy employed in BERT, which involves masking some of the words in an input sentence and training the model to predict them given their context, results in a versatile language model suited for many tasks. Nevertheless, existing self-supervision methods operate on the word-form level, and as such, they are inherently limited. Take the word \u2018bass\u2019 as an example: in one context it can refer to a fish, in a second to a guitar, in the third to a type of singer, and so on. The word itself is merely a surrogate of its actual meaning in a given context - referred to as its\nsense\n.\nWord-Sense predictions made by SenseBERT on a raw input text.\nThe word \"Bass\" maps to its different supersenses according to context.\nSenseBERT - Pre-training on Word Senses\nWe propose a method to employ self-supervision directly at the word sense level. Our model, named\nSenseBERT\n, is pre-trained to predict not only the masked words (as in BERT) but also their WordNet supersenses. BERT\u2019s current word-form level objective leads to what is commonly referred to as a language model: the model predicts words for the given masked position in a sentence. Our added task allows SenseBERT to gather word-sense level statistics and thereby we effectively train a semantic-level language model that predicts the missing word\u2019s meaning jointly with the standard word-form level prediction.\nSelf-supervision allows neural language models to learn from massive amounts of unannotated text. In order to enjoy this advantage at the lexical-semantic level, we make use of WordNet - an expert-constructed ontology that provides an inventory of word senses. We focus on a coarse-grained variant of word senses, referred to as supersenses, divided into 45 types that semantically categorize the entire language.\nLabeling of words with a single supersense, for example the word \u2018sword\u2019 which has only the supersense \u2018artifact\u2019, is straightforward: We train the network to predict this supersense given the masked word\u2019s context. As for words with multiple supersenses (like the word \u2018bass\u2019 we discussed earlier), we train the model to predict any of these senses, leading to a simple yet effective labeling scheme.\nOther than our additional pre-training task and the architecture changes that support it, we followed the architecture and training methods published in the BERT paper. Specifically, we trained models in two sizes, similar to BERT model sizes - SenseBERTBASE and SenseBERTLARGE. Our results below show significantly enhanced word meaning understanding abilities of SenseBERT, achieved without human annotation.\nWord-Sense predictions made by SenseBERT on the masked word in the sentence.\nResults\n  \nIn order to test our model\u2019s lexical semantic abilities, we compared it with BERT on two tasks:\n1.  SemEval Word Superense Disambiguation\nWe constructed a supersense variant of the SemEval-based WSD task, where the goal is to predict a word\u2019s supersense given context.\nWe trained and tested in two different schemes:\nA \u201cFrozen\u201d model with a linear classifier on top (to explore the sense information captured in the model\u2019s pre-trained embeddings).\nA \u201cFine-Tuned\u201d model, where the network weights have been modified during training.\nSenseBERTBASE outscores both BERTBASE and BERTLARGE models by a large margin in both cases, and SenseBERTLARGE yields even higher results.\n2.  Word in Context (WiC)\n \nThe Word in Context (WiC) task, from the SuperGLUE benchmark, is the task of predicting whether a word has the same meaning in two given sentences. This task heavily depends on word-supersense awareness.\nSenseBERTBASE surpasses BERTLARGE, and a single SenseBERTLARGE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task with a score of 72.14.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nOri Ram, Yoav Levine, Itay Dalmedigos, Dor Muhlgay, Amnon Shashua, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Yoav Shoham\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

An outstanding Achilles\u2019 heel of LM generated text is that it is not attributed to a specific source, and often includes factual inaccuracies or errors. This problem is present in any LM generation scenario, and is exacerbated when generation is made in uncommon domains, or when it involves up-to-date information that the LM has not seen during training. A promising approach for addressing this challenge is Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM), grounding the LM during generation by conditioning on relevant documents retrieved from an external knowledge source.\nLeading RALM systems introduced in recent years tend to be focused on altering the language model architecture, and the need for changes in architecture and dedicated retraining has hindered the wide adoption of such models.\nThus, while the RALM approach bears potential to alleviate factual inaccuracies and to provide direct sources for the generated text, it is in practice not deployed alongside leading LMs.\nIn our paper\n, we present In-Context RALM: a simple yet powerful RALM method which can be used for endowing any off-the-shelf LM with access to external knowledge sources. In-Context RALM simply inserts the retrieved document to a regular LM\u2019s input, rendering it applicable even for LM behind API . While existing works choose which documents to show the LM via standard general purpose approaches, we propose several novel methods for grounded generation oriented document selection.\n \nOur simple and easily deployable setup allows improving the language modeling abilities of off-the-shelf LMs to those equivalent to increasing the LM's number of parameters by 4X\n, across a diverse evaluation set of five text corpora. We believe that further gains can be achieved via developing the generation-oriented retrieval mechanism, while retaining the straightforward document insertion mechanism of RALM.\nTo help others both to deploy and to build upon our work, our paper is accompanied by an online release of all our code, datasets, trained models, and indexes for our standardized suite of corpora.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nOri Ram, Yoav Levine, Itay Dalmedigos, Dor Muhlgay, Amnon Shashua, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Yoav Shoham\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

By preventing the model from focusing on shallow local signals, PMI-Masking achieves better representations at a fraction of the training budget. Despite altering only the input masking strategy, PMI-Masking achieves the same BERT pretraining quality in one sixth the time and achieves significantly better pretraining within the same training budget.\nMasking: BERT\u2019s Added Degree of Freedom\nBefore BERT, neural Language Models (LMs) tended to be autoregressive, learning to predict each input token given preceding text. The Masked Language Model (MLM) training objective of BERT, for which the model learns to predict a masked subset of the input tokens, creates an inherently bidirectional representation of text. But this bidirectionality comes with an added degree of freedom relative to classical autoregressive LMs: choosing which tokens to mask and which to show.\nOur paper highlights that not all bidirectional dependencies are equal: we show that the strategy for choosing which tokens to mask and which to show can profoundly impact an MLM\u2019s performance. Specifically, we show that the standard practice of random uniform masking often allows an MLM to minimize its training objective by latching onto shallow local signals, leading to pretraining inefficiency and suboptimal downstream performance. By limiting the model\u2019s ability to rely on such shortcuts, we obtain the same pretraining performance more quickly and better performance within a fixed training budget.\nPMI-Masking speed-up and improvement relatively to existing approaches on RACE.\nA Motivating Example\nTo see the potential harm of local signals, we offer a simple, motivating example of neighboring tokens that are highly correlated with each other: part-of-word tokens that make up the same word. Recall that BERT represents text as a sequence of tokens, where each token is either a word or a part-of-word; e.g., \u201cchair\u201d might constitute a single token while rarer words like \u201ceigenvalue\u201d do not make it into BERT\u2019s vocabulary and are broken up into several part-of-word tokens (\u201ce-igen-val-ue\u201d).\nWhen using BERT\u2019s regular vocabulary size of 30K tokens, the vast majority of encountered words are represented by single tokens (words are represented via ~1.1 tokens on average). However, when we artificially decrease the vocabulary size to 10K and then to 2K tokens, along the x axis of the following plot, part-of-word tokens become much more common (up to ~2 tokens-per-word on average).\nThe blue curve in the above figure shows that when applying BERT\u2019s strategy of choosing 15% of the tokens for masking uniformly at random, the model's performance is severely degraded as part-of-word tokens become prevalent. Thus, by controlling the number of highly correlated tokens, we demonstrate that strong dependencies between neighboring input tokens can harm the model\u2019s ability to learn from broader context. In the presence of such dependencies, the MLM\u2019s objective can often be minimized simply by considering immediate neighbors of the masked token (consider the easy task \u201ce-igen-[mask]-ue\u201d).\nThe red curve in the above figure shows that the degradation is substantially attenuated when local cues are occluded. This is done by applying whole word masking, a popular masking strategy which jointly occludes all part-of-word tokens comprising a word. Our PMI-Masking strategy, presented below, extends this solution to a much more prevalent class of highly correlated tokens: correlated word n-grams.\nCorrelated Word N-Grams\nThe above example of part-of-word tokens illustrated a flaw in BERT\u2019s vanilla random masking approach, and the same issue occurs for correlated word n-grams, a class of correlated tokens that is harder to identify but affects any word level vocabulary. Examples include phrases and multi-word expressions such as \u201ceditor in chief\u201d, \u201cat once\u201d, \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d, and so on. More broadly, many words provide a hint regarding the identity of their neighbors, and such shallow cues can be used by the model to minimize its objective while putting less emphasis on broader context.\nPrevious work has proposed masking strategies that can mitigate the effect of such local cues. Notably, Sun et al. (2019) proposed Knowledge Masking, which jointly masks tokens comprising entities and phrases, as identified by external parsers. The restriction to specific types of correlated n-grams, along with the reliance on imperfect tools for their identification, has limited the gains of this approach. With a similar motivation in mind, SpanBERT of Joshi et al. (2020) introduced Random-Span Masking, which masks word spans of lengths sampled from a geometric distribution at random positions in the text. Random-Span Masking was shown to consistently outperform Knowledge Masking, however, with high probability the selected spans break up correlated n-grams, such that the prediction task can often be performed by relying on local cues.\nWe offer a principled approach to masking spans that consistently provide high signal, unifying the intuitions behind the above approaches while also outperforming them.\nIn order to identify highly correlated word n-grams, we rely on the measure of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), which quantifies how surprising a bigram w1w2 is, given the unigram probabilities of w1 and w2 in the corpus. Formally, given two tokens w1 and w2, the PMI of the bigram w1w2 is:\nWhere the probability of an n-gram p(w1... wn) is computed by the number of its occurrences in the corpus divided by the number of all n-grams in the corpus.\nPMI is a good indicator of correlation between words comprising a bigram, but extending it to measure correlation between words comprising longer n-grams is nontrivial. We propose the following extension of PMI to longer n-grams, and show that it provides a better signal than existing alternatives:\nwhere seg(w1... wn) is the set of all contiguous segmentations of the n-gram w1... wn (excluding the identity segmentation), and where any segmentation \u03c3 \u2208 seg(w1... wn) is composed of sub-spans that together give w1... wn.\nIntuitively, this measure discards the contribution of high PMI subsegments of the considered n-gram; the minimum in the equation above implies that an n-gram's score is given by its weakest link, i.e., by the segmentation that comes closest to separability. This way, trigrams such as \u201cKuala Lumpur is\u201d are deranked, since despite the bigram \u201cKuala Lumpur\u201d having high PMI it is not highly correlated with the word \u201cis\u201d, whereas \u201ceditor in chief\u201d, which cannot be broken to uncorrelated subsegments, is promoted for joint masking.\nExperiments\nBy jointly masking n-grams with high PMIn scores, we speed up and improve BERT\u2019s pretraining. When training models with either BERT\u2019s vanilla random-token masking, SpanBERT\u2019s random-span masking or PMI-Masking, in BERT\u2019s original training setup (see details in paper), we get the following 1 to 2 point advantage in prominent benchmarks:\nWhen comparing to prominent released models of the same size (see table at the top of this post), we see that:\nPMI-Masking outperforms a parallel approach of integrating word n-grams as tokens (PMI-Masking vs. AMBERT).\nPMI-Masking retains its advantage over random-span masking when training continues for 2.4 times longer than BERT\u2019s original training (PMI-Masking vs. SpanBERT).\nPMI-Masking reaches the performance attained by vanilla random-token masking after \u2159 of the training time (PMI-Masking vs. RoBERTa).\n1  Sun et al.

But for the uninitiated:\nUbisoft is the creator of Assassin's Creed, Just Dance, Watch Dogs, and multiple other incredibly well-crafted and popular video games. They were one of the first brands to invent rich, immersive, story-driven gaming worlds\u2014back in the early 1980s.\nThe company was founded on the principles of embracing human creativity and grew to rapid popularity by the early 90s. Always ahead of the curve, Ubisoft built their first AI gaming lab 6 years ago.\nThe story\nThe script writers' work at the company is the cornerstone of the complex artifact that is a narrative driven game.  They create diverse and interactive elements - from sequential in-game cinematics to procedurally generated crowd chatter.\nWe talked to Ben Swanson, research scientist at Ubisoft about the challenges they were facing and how A121 helped.\nWhy AI21 Labs? Creator-friendly vision, ready-to-use models, and legal compliance.\nUbisoft and AI21 Labs share a common vision: create tools to automate tedious tasks so writers can focus on creative pursuits.\n\u201cOur writers do excellent work. We want to assist them with whatever tools and models that we can.\u201d says Swanson. AI21 Labs\u2019s Wordtune has a similar philosophy. This vision and passion for the possibilities of human-machine collaborative writing stood out to Ubisoft in their search for a reliable large language model.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been leading towards AI21 Labs because we\u2019ve had positive internal reviews from team members who\u2019ve worked with AI21 Labs previously.\u201d\nAlso, Ubisoft utilized AI21 Labs\u2019s vanilla model from the get-go. Very often, with LLMs, companies need a lot of customization and fine-tuning, but AI21\u2019s model was a perfect fit for Ubisoft\u2019s data augmentation needs. The intuitive API made the integration even easier.\nFinally, AI21 went the extra mile by ironing out legal compliance issues that have been a point of contention in other LLM partnerships.\nWith a model-usage fit and shared values, Ubisoft set out to enhance their game-creation process with AI21.\nThe first challenge:\nrepetitive manual work for video game writers\nOne of the many different tasks that goes into scriptwriting is writing bark trees which are standalone NPC lines that require as many variations as possible (and allowed by the voiceover budget). Each of these groups of variations can be seen as responses to a shared motivation.\nFor example, if the motivation is hunger, the character might say \u201clet\u2019s order pizza.\u201d\nSimply paraphrasing \u201clet\u2019s order pizza\u201d wouldn\u2019t work in this case.\n\u201cThere's only so much you can do with paraphrasing. You actually have to pivot through the motivation or start from the motivation.\u201d says Ben.\nUbisoft saw the value AI21 brought to the game development process. Instead of having to painstakingly brainstorm 5-10 different ways to express motivation (hunger, in this example), Ubisoft\u2019s internal models could use AI21\u2019s output as a launch pad.\n\u201cIt lets our writers hit the ground running. It's an Inspiration tool for them. It's a way for them to overcome writer\u2019s block.\u201d says Swanson.\nThe second challenge:\nneed for data augmentation\nTo create an engine for automatic paraphrasing, Ubisoft had to use internal models. And to reliably use internal models, they needed fine tuning data (which didn\u2019t exist). If they\u2019d tasked humans with creating this fine-tuning data, it would have taken an eternity.\n\u201cSo we use AI21 to suggest data of the correct form. It\u2019s easier for writers to thumbs up and edit or thumbs down than to come up with novel and diverse training data themselves.\u201d says Ben.\nWith AI21, Ubisoft could generate thousands of inputs and hand-pick the best ones to edit using their fine tuning datasets. With this augmented data set, the outputs became more diverse, and distinctive.\nUbisoft embeds the NPC generator and other similar models they\u2019ve trained into the writing tools for their scripters. The writers are shown pairwise comparisons of outputs so the models can get further trained through human feedback.\n\u201cBefore AI21 we wouldn\u2019t do this manually \u2014 we weren\u2019t doing it\nat all\n. It was THAT tedious. \u201c says Swanson. \u201cWhat we unlocked by our partnership with AI21 is an unlimited fountain of training data of whatever precise format we require!\u201d\nThe third challenge:\nrising costs of in-context learning (data augmentation)\nWith an unlimited fountain of training data, the next challenge was that of escalating data augmentation costs.\nMost LLM brands charge based on both input and output tokens.\nWith a 30:1 input to output ratio, Ubisoft successfully optimized their budget for game creation.\nThis created an obstacle: Ubisoft wanted to fine-tune the outputs to the minutest detail so their writers would work on high-quality suggestions. This meant experimenting with multiple prompts which would cost them significantly more money.\nAI21 customized their pricing model to aid Ubisoft in their vision: top-notch AI-generated recommendations so writers have more inspiration (and lesser manual work). AI21 charged them only for output tokens.\n\u201cAI21's pricing model at that time was the best for data augmentation.\u201d adds Ben.\nWhat changed for Ubisoft after working with AI21?\n\u201cThe win here is rapid scaling. When it comes to writing a game, there's a tremendous amount of tedious work. For example, there need to be 10-15 different ways for a townsperson to \u201cget out of here\u201d \u2014 or it\u2019s going to sound repetitive.\nWriters often talk about having an editing brain and a writing brain \u2014 the writing brain requires you to conjure something from nothing. The editing brain is where you polish it. So if you can jump to the editing step, that's huge.\n\u201cThat's the promise of AI21: quality data augmentation outputs\",says Ben.\nThe road forward\nOver a third of our conversation with Ubisoft was future-facing. Because of both teams' synchronicity, capabilities, and common beliefs, there are dozens of use cases to be built. Here\u2019s what Ubisoft is most excited about:\nBuilding a statistical reference model for video games engineered from AI21 Labs\u2019s generative AI capabilities: Ubisoft\u2019s vision to design creator-inspired, immersive games helps them build worlds with rich history, depth of character, and dramatic storylines. AI21 Labs plans to document these complex worlds to offer stats and facts to players on command.\n\u201cThe nice thing about AI21\u2019s setup (as opposed to the kind of LLM usage in video games you often see these days where it's basically just a chatbot) is that our setup leverages LLMs in a writer-in-the-loop scenario.  Additionally, as it relies on data augmentation and fine tuning, it allows writers to compose their own I/O - keeping it as a tool for them rather than a lower-quality replacement.\u201d says Ben.\nAt AI21, not only are we thrilled to bring Ubisoft\u2019s vision for innovation to life, but we are thrilled about the opportunities for contributing to a creator-first world.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you! Your submission has been received!\nBack to Blog\nMRKL Whitepaper\nPaper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language Models\nTry for yourself\nWhat is a MRKL system?\nIn August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We\u2019re thankful for the reception it got \u2013 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can\u2019t access your company database, don\u2019t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can\u2019t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don\u2019t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.\nA MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCompositive multi-expert problem: the list of \u201cGreen energy companies\u201d is routed to Wiki API, \u201clast month\u201d dates are extracted from the calendar and \u201cshare prices\u201d from the database. The \u201clargest increase\u201c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.\nThere are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them,\nsee our MRKL paper\n. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion,\nsee our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.\nA further look at the advantages of Jurassic-X\nEven without diving into technical details, it\u2019s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.\nReading and updating your databases in free language\nAI-assisted content generation on current affairs\nPerforming simple and complex math operations.\nDecomposing multi-step problems\nAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)\nReading and updating your database in free language\nLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company\u2019s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can \u2018talk\u2019 to your data to explore what you need-  \u201cFind the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell\u201d, \u201cWhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?\u201d and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).\nJurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language\nAI-assisted text generation on current affairs\nLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world\u2019s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.\nJurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.\nWho is the president of the United States?\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nJoe Biden is the\n46th and current\npresident\nJurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata\nPerforming math operations\nA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language.\nImportantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.\nThe company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?\n94 employees.\nEach employee got 7000 stocks\n1.5\n(No answer provided)\n6972.3\nX= 655400/94\nJurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator\nCompositionality\nSolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - \u201cDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\u201d requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can\u2019t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.\nDo more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?\nBerlin\nThere are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.\nBerlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size\n(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)\nMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv\n[\u2018Return population of Tel Aviv\u2019; Return population of Berlin\u2019; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2\u2019]\nStep 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.\nStep 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.\nStep 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.\nJurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system\nDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)\nCertain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.\nWeather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.\nI\u2019m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?\nYes, you should pack your umbrella.\nYes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

Each example consists of a\nprompt\n, which is a valid input text, and a\ncompletion\n, which is a correct output for that specific prompt.\nAt least\n50\ntraining examples are required to train a custom model. If you upload a file that contains fewer than 50 examples, you will encounter an error. More is better, so provide as many examples as you can.\nNo! Data quality and diversity matter as well, so it\u2019s a good idea to go over your examples manually and make sure they accurately capture various aspects of your task. It's critical that your examples reflect the real-world distribution of your problem.\nThe dataset must be submitted in a single\nor\nfile. We recommend using a\nfile due to better handling of line breaks.\nfile, it should have two columns labeled \"prompt\" and \"completion\". Each row should contain a single training example, with no empty rows in between.\nIf you are submitting a\nfile, each line in the file should be a\ndictionary with two fields: \"prompt\" and \"completion\".\nBelow is a simple example for both\n.csv\nand\n.jsonl\nformats:\ncsv\nJSON\nprompt,completion\n\"Where was the steam engine invented?\",England\n\"In what year did the US gain its independence?\",1776\n\"Who was the longest reigning roman emperor?\",Augustus\n{\"prompt\": \"Where was the steam engine invented?\\n\", \"completion\": \"England\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"In what year did the US gain its independence?\\n\", \"completion\": \"1776\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"Who was the longest reigning roman emperor?\\n\", \"completion\": \"Augustus\"}\nUploading a file with fewer than two columns or with inconsistent columns in different lines will result in an error.\nYou may upload files with different column names - in which case, you will be prompted to identify the desired prompt column and the desired completion column.\n\u2757\ufe0f\nCompletions cannot be empty.\nHowever, prompts can be empty.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\ud83d\udd22 How many examples do I need?\n\ud83e\udde9 It's all about quantity?\nFile Formats\n\ud83d\uded1 Common Errors", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/training-data"}, {"title": "How Easyway Uses AI-Powered Chat to Automate Communication for Luxury Hotels", "text": "Company\nAbout\nAsk RBG\nStart building\nA luxury hotel that wants to provide exceptional hospitality must deliver a 5-star experience throughout the guest's entire journey, from the moment they arrive on the website until they check out.\nBut how can these hotels give personalized attention to guests with 200 and more messages a day without relying on gimmicky chatbots?\nAsaf Ofer, CTO and Founder of Easyway, discussed their current use of AI and how he plans to scale it.\nWhat is Easyway?\nEasyway is a guest relationship management platform (GRM) that facilitates two-way communication between guests and the hotel through instant messaging apps such as Whatsapp, SMS, Telegram, and more.\nUsing their technology, hotels are able to automate communication and streamline daily operations like check-in and check-out processes.\nSince Easyway serves mostly luxury hotels that cater to a 4- and 5-star experience, every touchpoint is crucial for delivering high-end customer service. Aiming to improve certain aspects of their platform, they turned to AI21 Labs to take their product to a new level.\nWhy They Chose AI21: An LLM Solution that Mimics Human Interaction\nSince Easyway isn't a chatbot, but rather an AI-powered chat platform, they needed a solution that wasn't readily available on the market. They looked for an AI platform with enough scientific and engineering innovation to be able to understand and generate natural text.\n\u201cThe guest needs to feel like they're speaking to a human and not a chatbot,\u201d says Asaf. \u201cIf we automate it in a human and customized way, hotels need less staff, and people feel like they're being treated like special guests every time.\u201d\nThe Problem with Other Models on the Market\nEasyway started out using other models that could answer common questions, but only if those questions were asked in the most common and simple form. A slight deviation would cause the entire model to fail.\n\u201cPeople had questions that it didn\u2019t know how to respond to, because it never saw these questions [asked this way] before,\u201d Asaf explains. \u201cSometimes it was wrongly confident about what was being asked because it didn't get a lot of examples to work with.\u201d\nAI21\u2019s Personalized Customer Service & Assistance to the Rescue\nWith the assistance of AI21, the Easyway team was able to train their model using a few dozen custom-made prompts. \u201cWe had several calls, I showed them our results and they helped me clean up and set up the training data correctly,\u201d says Asaf.\nAI21 helped Asaf\u2019s team break the process down to steps, translate it into code, and find discrepancies in the data. Finally, the Easyway team managed to arrive at their desired solution.\nIt was through this level of support that Easyway was able to use AI21 to upgrade their application.\nUse Case #1: Intent Detection\nWith AI21's proprietary Large language Models (LLMs), Easyway was able to analyze intent with high accuracy. Easyway now uses a sentiment analysis model based on fifteen frequently asked questions.\n\u201cWe gave the model a question and it gives us back 1 out of several possible intents,\u201d says Asaf. He goes on to explain that if the model doesn\u2019t exactly know that answer, then it\u2019s okay not to respond at all \u2013 sometimes, it\u2019s actually better for business not to. That\u2019s due to the fact that inappropriately responding to an already frustrated or angry customer may only fuel the situation rather than alleviating it.\nThis feature will lead to even bigger things in the future, says Asaf. \u201cOnce we have a reliable solution for detecting sentiment, we\u2019d be able to automate much more - If the system detects that a guest is angry, we could immediately notify the manager. If a guest is satisfied, we\u2019d ask them to leave a review, etc.\u201d\nUse Case #2: Automatic Translation\nEvery hotel is filled with travelers from and to various countries. The importance of having a staff with multiple languages cannot be overstated. However, knowledge of every language is not always possible, which is why translation apps are useful.\nEasyway offers high-quality 2-way translation capabilities in 100+ languages. \u201cA Spanish guest will speak Spanish and the staff will be speaking Hebrew and the conversation will be understandable for each side,\u201d Asaf explains. \u201cSo each person can just use their native language, plus we use AI to respond to messages automatically.\u201d\nThis feature was already in production before Easyway reached out to AI21, but there was much room for improvement. \u201cOne of the gaps we had to tackle was a varying level of grammar amongst our end users. The problem involved two aspects; the level of service that our clients provide their guests, and the efficiency of our translation feature. If a person writing on our platform didn\u2019t write properly, the live translation wouldn\u2019t work properly.\u201d\nBy incorporating the same technology that is used in Wordtune, AI21\u2019s flagship AI writing assistant, this was made possible.\nThe Future for Easyway\nWhat if you could not only automate away repetitive questions, but also begin to automatically set common responses to FAQs?\nEasyway is currently running a pilot to embed a chat widget on one of their partners\u2019 websites, gearing up for a possible new offer. \u201cWe\u2019re [piloting this feature] with a customer in Europe that has a lot of visitors to their website - around 150K each month, and they don't have the staff to deal with it. So they just end up with thousands of emails asking basic questions that nobody responds to,\u201d Asaf says.\nWith Easyway, hotels can automate and schedule messages based on events such as booking, arrival, and departure.\nA typical post-booking conversation could be:\n\u201cHey Asaf, thank you for booking your stay with us. Do you have any questions?\u201d\nAsaf may type: \u201cHow do I get to the hotel?\u201d or \u201cWhat are the Covid regulations?\u201d\nThe chat platform is set up to respond automatically, helping hotels save time with quality AI.\nThe Result: Automated, Human-Centered Conversations that Save Time\nRemember those 200 or more messages we mentioned hotels can receive each day? To reach success, Easyway will look at how many emails each hotel actually needs to personally answer after using their application powered by AI21. Asaf stated that a \u201c10, 20, 30% [reduction rate] would be amazing.\u201d\nOverall, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our NLP technology to help alleviate the administrative burdens that hotels experience on a daily basis \u2013 while still uplifting the 5-star experience guests want from their hotel of choice.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nEnjoyed this?\nStay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.\nThank you!

The weather forecast is rain.\n(Links to weather websites)\nYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.\nCurrency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.\nHow much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?\n125 dirhams\n100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.\nHow much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?\n100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars\n100 USD = 934.003 MAD\nJurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources\nTransparency and trust\nTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - \u201cWas Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?\u201d. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X\u2019s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.\nWas Clinton ever elected president of the United States?\nT0\nYes\nGPT-3\nNo, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.\nJurassic-1\nNo\nGoogle\nClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections\u2026\nJurassic-X\nBill Clinton was elected president.\nJurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response\nYour Turn\nThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

Assuming you\u2019ve already created a prompt with just a few examples that works well for your task, you can leverage it in one of two ways:\nIf you have examples of inputs that represent your use case, feed them to J2 with your prompt, and collect the outputs generated by the model. The pairs of inputs and generated outputs will be your training set. Note that you can often collect relevant input examples relatively easily, either from public sources on the web or from your own data.\nIf you don\u2019t have access to relevant input examples, you can let J2 generate both the inputs and the outputs. Feed J2 with a sequence of examples (input #1, output #1, input #2, output #2, and so on), and let it generate more examples. This tends to work well for short inputs, up to a few sentences long, but may result in a higher rate of bad examples for longer inputs (e.g., whole articles).\nThe process above is illustrated step-by-step in our\nblog post\n. Using J2-Jumbo or J2-Grande rather than J2-Large is recommended for generating synthetic training data, since it typically produces higher quality results with prompt engineering.\nWe recommend you review and validate the generated content (or at least a sample from it) before training a custom model. This will ensure the data properly captures the desired behavior. Watch out for incorrect, corrupted or toxic generations, as including these in the training data will negatively affect the resulting custom model. If you find such bad examples, amend them manually or simply exclude them from the training data.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\u27bf Synthesizing training data", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/collecting-data"}, {"title": "Contextual Answers API [BETA]", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nGetting Started\nOverview\nQuickstart\nKey Concepts\nLarge Language Models\nTokenizer & Tokenization\nWhen Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?\nSampling From Language Models\nPrompt Engineering\nAdvanced\nSpecial Tokens and Whitespaces\nRepetition Penalties\nLogit Bias\nFoundation Models\nJurassic-2 Models\nInstruct Models\nCustom Models\nJurassic-1 Models [Legacy]\nTask-Specific APIs\nTask-Specific APIs Overview\nParaphrase API\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nText Improvements API\nSummarize API\nText Segmentation API\nHow To...\nBuild a Dataset\nDatasets: Best Practices\nGenerating More Data Using AI21 Studio\nTips: Building a Dataset\nTrain a Custom Model\nTips: Training a Custom Model\nQuery your Custom Model\nWorking with amazon sagemaker\nPython SDK - with Amazon SageMaker\nChoosing the Right Instance Type\nUsage\nResponsible Use\nSafety Research\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nReceives a document and a question and returns an answer based entirely on the document context.\nHaving trouble with language models that provide false information with high confidence? Would you like answers solely based on your document context? Well, we have just the thing for you! The AI21 Studio\n/answer\nAPI allows you to access our high-quality question answering technology. It was designed to answer questions based on a specific document context provided by the customer. This avoids any factual issues that language models may have and makes sure the answers it provides are grounded in that context document.\nundefined\nWhether you're an NLP enthusiast or have no prior knowledge, this API is for you. There are many clever mechanisms under the hood, but you don't have to understand them (if you don't want to). As a task-specific API, you can easily integrate it into your systems and get a high-quality, grounded question answering mechanism in a matter of minutes, with no prompt engineering required. Additionally, since it's optimized for this purpose, it's significantly more efficient than building it from scratch, and an order of magnitude more affordable.\nThis API receives document text, serving as a context, and a question and returns an answer based entirely on this context. This means that if the answer to your question is not in the document, the model will indicate it (instead of providing a false answer).\nNo matter what you ask, the answer will only be determined by the document context. Imagine you are performing research and rely on financial reports to base your findings. Let's take the following part from\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. 2021 annual report\n:\nDocument context\nIn 2020 and 2021, enormous QE \u2014 approximately $4.4 trillion, or 18%, of 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 and enormous fiscal stimulus (which has been and always will be inflationary) \u2014 approximately $5 trillion, or 21%, of 2021 GDP \u2014 stabilized markets and allowed companies to raise enormous amounts of capital. In addition, this infusion of capital saved many small businesses and put more than $2.5 trillion in the hands of consumers and almost $1 trillion into state and local coffers. These actions led to a rapid decline in unemployment, dropping from 15% to under 4% in 20 months \u2014 the magnitude and speed of which were both unprecedented. Additionally, the economy grew 7% in 2021 despite the arrival of the Delta and Omicron variants and the global supply chain shortages, which were largely fueled by the dramatic upswing in consumer spending and the shift in that spend from services to goods. Fortunately, during these two years, vaccines for COVID-19 were also rapidly developed and distributed.\nIn today's economy, the consumer is in excellent financial shape (on average), with leverage among the lowest on record, excellent mortgage underwriting (even though we've had home price appreciation), plentiful jobs with wage increases and more than $2 trillion in excess savings, mostly due to government stimulus. Most consumers and companies (and states) are still flush with the money generated in 2020 and 2021, with consumer spending over the last several months 12% above pre-COVID-19 levels. (But we must recognize that the account balances in lower-income households, smaller to begin with, are going down faster and that income for those households is not keeping pace with rising inflation.)\nToday's economic landscape is completely different from the 2008 financial crisis when the consumer was extraordinarily overleveraged, as was the financial system as a whole \u2014 from banks and investment banks to shadow banks, hedge funds, private equity, Fannie Mae and many other entities. In addition, home price appreciation, fed by bad underwriting and leverage in the mortgage system, led to excessive speculation, which was missed by virtually everyone \u2014 eventually leading to nearly $1 trillion in actual losses.\nRather than reading the entire report, just ask what you want to know:\nDid the economy shrink after the Omicron variant arrived?\nNo, the economy grew 7% in 2021, despite the arrival of the Delta and Omicron variants and the global supply chain shortages.\nIn addition, you can ask more complex questions, where the answer requires deductions rather than just extracting the correct sentence from the document context. This will result in abstractive, rather than extractive, answers that draw on several different parts of the document. For example, look at the following question:\nDid COVID-19 eventually help the economy?\nThe dramatic rise in consumer spending and the shift in that spend from services to goods, along with QE and fiscal stimulus, helped to stimulate the economy.\nWhen working with these types of models, the main concern is that they will give you a made-up answer that is neither 100% accurate nor grounded in your provided text. Our Contextual Answers API prevents this from happening.\nUsing the same document text as above, we present the model with the following question. You may be confused to answer something based on the last paragraph without delving into the text. However, if you read the provided document context properly, you will discover that the answer does not appear there. The API will handle this as expected:\nHow did COVID-19 affect the financial crisis of 2008?\nAnswer not in document\nThis API is very useful when working with large amounts of internal data, such as organization documents. You can build a system that provides all the information a user needs without having to read long and tedious documents, knowing that the answers are reliable.\nYou've probably heard of RTFM (Read The\nFriendly\nManual). However, sometimes the manual may not be as friendly as you would like. By integrating this API into your system, your users can ask questions without needing to search. As an example, here is one from\nWikipedia docs:\nContext\nContent\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines \u00a7 Not part of the encyclopedia, and Wikipedia:Be bold \u00a7 Wikipedia namespace\nSee also: Wikipedia:User pages \u00a7 What may I not have in my user pages?\nPages within the \"Project namespace\" themselves are not part of the encyclopedia proper. These administrative pages are intended for use by editors or by automated tools for the organization and governance of the encyclopedia. Consequently, they do not generally need to conform to the same content protocols or style conventions as articles. Nevertheless, these pages, as with all pages, should be accessible and must comply with Wikipedia's conduct and legal policies.\n\nThe project namespace is not a free web host and should not be used as a long-term archive to host pages that look like articles. Articles in the project namespace under construction may be moved to the draft namespace or Userspace draft allowing time for their development and feedback before being moved to Wikipedia's mainspace. Stalled or abandoned drafts and pages in the project namespace that violate policies applicable to non-content pages may be subject to deletion. Editors may not violate copyrights or harass anywhere on Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, these types of pages are subject to expeditious deletion. See below for more information.\n\nPages within project namespace\nThe project namespace pages are organized according to their function within the overall project schema. This includes Wikipedia official policies and guidelines, process pages, discussion pages, optional essays, maintenance pages, informative pages, and historical pages.\n\nFor lists of pages in the project namespace, see:\n\nWikipedia:Directories and indexes \u2013 a handy list of Wikipedia's directories and indexes.\nWikipedia:Department directory \u2013 a list of the different administrative divisions of Wikipedia.\nWikipedia:Editor's index to Wikipedia \u2013 an enormous list of the Wikipedia community, intended to help\n...Text Truncated...\n\nYour users can simply ask what they want instead of reading the entire doc:\nQuestion\nHow do I delete my wiki page?\nAnswer\nTo delete a page, first post a request at miscellany for deletion to have project pages deleted. Make sure that a notice of the request is posted to the talk page of the affected project. If the project is under a parent WikiProject, a notice should be posted there as well.\nUpdated\n9 days ago\nTable of Contents\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it, give it a go! \ud83d\udcab\nFeatures\nIt\u2019s all about the\ncontext\nThe answer is\nnot in the document\n?

Note that this is different from few-shot prompt engineering for a general purpose model, where the prompt contains a sequence of examples of valid inputs and outputs.\nIn any case, the\ncombined length\nof the prompt and completion must not exceed 2047 tokens or approximately 6000 characters of English text. If you include longer examples, you will encounter an error after uploading the file.\nFor best results, we recommend implementing the following guidelines for the prompt and completion. All the snippets below assume a\n.jsonl\nformat is being used, but the same guidelines are applicable to a\n.csv\nfile.\nEither of these helps avoid complications due to tokenization. Don\u2019t mix and match; pick one and stick with it for all examples in the training set. See examples below:\nEnding the prompt with a newline\nStarting the completion with a whitespace\n{\"prompt\": \"Where was the steam engine invented?\\n\", \"completion\": \"England\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"Where was the steam engine invented?\", \"completion\": \" England\"}\nYou should clearly mark the boundary between the prompt and the completion. A simple way to do this is to insert a separator at the end of each prompt. You can use any simple, distinct sequence, such as\n##\non a new line.\nIt is often a good idea to take this a step further by using titles. You can append a title that describes the input to the beginning of the prompt, and another title that describes the output to the end of the prompt (in place of the separator). The titles can be short, but it usually helps to pick straightforward titles that are not generic and relate to the content of the input and output.\nAgain, it\u2019s important to be consistent. Pick one style and stick with it. If you use titles, they should be the same in all training examples. In any case, keep in mind the first guideline and either end the prompt with a newline or start the completion with a whitespace.\nSee a few examples below:\nSeparator\nTitles\nTitles with newlines\n{\"prompt\": \"I know so many languages\\n##\\n\", \"completion\": \"Ich kenne so viele Sprachen\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"English: I know so many languages\\nGerman:\", \"completion\": \" Ich kenne so viele Sprachen\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"English:\\nI know so many languages\\nGerman:\\n\", \"completion\": \"Ich kenne so viele Sprachen\"}\nAdding a short instruction that explains the task to each prompt often improves results. As before, stay consistent and use the same instruction in all examples.\nDO - include instruction\nDON'T - without instruction\n{\"prompt\": \"Translate the following text from English to German.\\nEnglish: It's my birthday today\\nGerman:\", \"completion\": \" Heute ist mein Geburtstag\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"English: It's my birthday today\\nGerman:\", \"completion\": \" Heute ist mein Geburtstag\"}\nDuplicate entries are detrimental to the training, so we recommend removing them.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nDon't have enough examples?\nMake sure you don't duplicate existing examples to reach 50 examples. If you do not have more examples, you can use AI21 Studio to generate some based on the ones you do have.\nYou can also train a custom model to perform tasks that have more than one input. Simply combine all the inputs into the prompt, with an appropriate title for each input. For example, consider a model trained to generate short ads for cars from a list of technical specifications. The different fields can be organized in a template as in the following example:\nModel name: Viesta\nFuel consumption: 60 MPG\nHorsepower: 100 HP\nPrice: $11,000\n##\nAn appropriate dataset for training such a model would look like the following:\nJSON\n{\"prompt\": \"Model name: Viesta\\nFuel consumption: 60 MPG\\nHorsepower: 100 HP\\nPrice: $11,000\\n##\\n\", \"completion\": \"The new Viesta model runs efficiently with an amazing 60 MPG fuel consumption, available now for $11,000.\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"Model name: Lambada\\nFuel consumption: 15 MPG\\nHorsepower: 500 HP\\nPrice:$120,000\\n##\\n\", \"completion\": \"Feel the power with the new Lambada, burning the road with a mind-blowing 500-Horsepower engine.\"}\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\nBest Practices for Prompt and Completion Content\n1.

There are three versions of Jurassic-1, differing by size:\nJ1-Jumbo\n, with 178B parameters, is the largest and most sophisticated language model ever released for general use by developers. Jumbo is the most capable model in the J1 family, but it's also the slowest and most expensive to run.\nJ1-Grande\n, with 17B parameters, is faster and more affordable than Jumbo, and more capable than Large.\nJ1-Large\n, with 7.5B parameters, is smaller, faster and more affordable but overall less capable than Jumbo, though still very effective for many use-cases.\nA complete description of Jurassic-1, including benchmarks and quantitative comparisons with other models, can be found in our\ntechnical paper\n.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\ud83e\udd96 Jurassic-1 Series", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/jurassic-1-models-legacy"}, {"title": "Paraphrase API", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nGetting Started\nOverview\nQuickstart\nKey Concepts\nLarge Language Models\nTokenizer & Tokenization\nWhen Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?\nSampling From Language Models\nPrompt Engineering\nAdvanced\nSpecial Tokens and Whitespaces\nRepetition Penalties\nLogit Bias\nFoundation Models\nJurassic-2 Models\nInstruct Models\nCustom Models\nJurassic-1 Models [Legacy]\nTask-Specific APIs\nTask-Specific APIs Overview\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nText Improvements API\nSummarize API\nText Segmentation API\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nHow To...\nBuild a Dataset\nDatasets: Best Practices\nGenerating More Data Using AI21 Studio\nTips: Building a Dataset\nTrain a Custom Model\nTips: Training a Custom Model\nQuery your Custom Model\nWorking with amazon sagemaker\nPython SDK - with Amazon SageMaker\nChoosing the Right Instance Type\nUsage\nResponsible Use\nSafety Research\nParaphrase API\nTakes a piece of text and returns a list of paraphrases that convey the same meaning using different words.\nAI21 Studio's\n/paraphrase\nAPI  offers access to our world-class paraphrasing engine. It has been specifically developed for suggesting alternative ways to convey the same message using different words. This is also the engine behind\nWordtune\n- our\naward winning writing assistant\n, so you know it's pretty awesome.\nundefined\nWhether you're an NLP enthusiast or have no prior knowledge, this API is for you. There are many clever mechanisms under the hood, but you don't have to understand them (if you don't want to). As a paraphrase-specific API, you can easily integrate it into your systems and get top-notch paraphrasing in a matter of minutes, with no prompt engineering required. Additionally, since it's optimized for this purpose, it's significantly more efficient than building it from scratch, and an order of magnitude cheaper.\nThis API takes a piece of text and returns a list of paraphrases that convey the same meaning using different words. As a specialized API for paraphrasing, it contains features to enable you more control over the output by adjusting the tone and style. Moreover, you can add additional context to the text, to make the rewrite suggestion more relevant (by paraphrasing a certain range of your text).\nYou have the choice between five different styles:\nGeneral - there are fresh and creative ways to rephrase sentences. Offer them to your users.\nCasual - convey a friendlier and more accessible tone for the right audience.\nFormal - present your words in a more professional way.\nShort - express your messages clearly and concisely.\nLong - expand your sentences to give more detail, nuance and depth.\nYou can paraphrase only part of the text while keeping the surrounding text unchanged by specifying a range within the text.\nBAD practices - AVOID THIS\nThe API aims to paraphrase exactly the requested range while avoiding disfluent suggestions. Satisfying both requirements is not always possible; in those cases, the call will result in an empty list of suggestions. Also, avoid paraphrasing texts that start or end mid-word.\nFor example, consider the sentence \u201cThis is a flat out bad example\u201d. Paraphrasing the word \u201cflat\u201d alone in this sentence without violating fluency is not possible, because \u201cflat\u201d is part of the term \u201cflat out\u201d. Paraphrasing \u201cflat\u201d alone is kind of like trying to paraphrase half a word. Cases like this usually yield few or no suggestions.\nBEST practices - you should do this\nConsider the following example for a paraphrase call:\nimport ai21\n\nai21.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n\nresponse = ai21.Paraphrase.execute(text=\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d We figured that we should create some pages that satisfied this need.\",\n                                   startIndex=116)\nAnd the response:\nJSON\n[\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Therefore, we decided to create some pages that answered this question.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Our team decided to create some pages to answer this question.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d This led to the idea of creating some pages that answered this question.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Thus, some pages were created to provide this information.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Thus, we decided to create some pages that address this issue.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Therefore, we designed some pages that addressed this question.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Therefore, we decided to create some pages that would fulfill this need.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Thus, we created some pages that provide that information.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Thus, we decided to create a few pages about this topic.\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"text\":\"My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, \u201cIs my contractor licensed?\u201d Th\n...Text Truncated...\n\nYou can see that the part until\nremains the same in all of the suggestions.\nThe\ncan be either the character you wish to paraphrase from, or a whitespace before it (in this case, it would have worked with\nstartIndex\n=115 as well).\nTo improve fluency, the range of the paraphrase may contain up to one word per direction. As an example, consider the following sentence (where the range is\nbolded\n):\nI had a\ngood night\n.\nAmong the suggestions, you may see\n\u201cI had a relaxing evening\u201d\n, where the range is on the limit, as well as\n\u201cI had an enjoyable evening\u201d\n, where you can see the range included an extra word before.\nBy integrating the Paraphrase API into your system, your users gain an embedded co-writer within the experience. This is useful for virtually all text-based tasks, from marketing content (like that post about a newly specialized API) to emails (a formal report to higher-ups or casual correspondence with a colleague) and even general descriptions. Following are some examples illustrating both use cases and special features you can take advantage of with this API.\nYou can enhance the writing experience of your users by adding paraphrasing functionality to your writing platforms. See the following example for a generic call, without any of the special features. Here is an example for paraphrasing suggestions (note that the API will return up to 10 suggestions in every call):\nText\nWe will explore the Paraphrase API's advantages and features throughout this page.\nThe Paraphrase API will be explored throughout this page.\nOn this page, we will look at the advantages and features of the Paraphrase API.\nIn this page, we'll explore Paraphrase API's benefits and features.\nThis page provides an overview of the Paraphrase API's advantages and features\nWe will discuss the benefits and features of the Paraphrase API throughout this page.\nJavaScript\nimport ai21\n\nai21.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n\nresponse = ai21.Paraphrase.execute(text=\"Throughout this page, we will explore the advantages and features of the Paraphrase API.\")\nimport requests\n\nfetch(\"https://api.ai21.com/studio/v1/paraphrase\", {\n  headers: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\",\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    \"text\": \"Throughout this page, we will explore the advantages and features of the Paraphrase API.\"\n  }),\n  method: \"POST\"\n});\n{\n   \"id\":\"e218271d-bc3a-3c31-5576-e6b09eb75f8b\",\n   \"suggestions\":[\n      {\n         \"text\":\"We will explore the Paraphrase API's advantages and features throughout this page.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"The Paraphrase API will be explored throughout this page.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"On this page, we will look at the advantages and features of the Paraphrase API.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"In this page, we'll explore Paraphrase API's benefits and features.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"This page explores the advantages and features of Paraphrase API.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"This page provides an overview of the Paraphrase API's advantages and features.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"We will discuss the benefits and features of the Paraphrase API throughout this page.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"During this page, you will learn about the features and advantages of the Paraphrase API.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"This page will explore the Paraphrase API's advantages and features.\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"text\":\"In this page, we'll discuss the advantages and features of the Paraphrase API.\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\nWriting product descriptions requires understanding your customers' needs and communicating the features and benefits of your product in an engaging, informative, and compelling manner. Also, as a copywriter, they need to keep a consistent tone in descriptions. On top of that, there is often a strict length restriction, which may cause multiple descriptions for the same product on different platforms. Offering your users different paraphrasing styles, such as shortening, can improve their productivity and help them provide high-quality results, all with their own voice and consistency.\nSee the following example for a call that combines a short style and the context feature, i.e. - paraphrase only part of the text, while maintaining the full context.

Custom models are fine-tuned for optimal performance on a training set of examples representing a\nspecific task\nCustom models can be trained to perform virtually any language task. Use cases include generating marketing copy, powering chatbots and assisting creative writing.\nYou can train custom models based on either J2-Grande or J2-Large (soon also J2-Jumbo) and pick your desired cost/quality trade-off.\nGiven a sufficient number of training examples, custom J2 models exceed the quality attainable with general purpose models and prompt engineering. For many use cases, you can expect custom models to begin outperforming prompt engineering with as few as 50-100 examples. To learn more, read our\n, where we address a specific language task, using both general purpose models and custom models.\nFurthermore, custom models derive their quality from the training data you provide; adding more, higher quality examples will improve results. This means you can continuously refine your custom model by curating high-quality data for your task.\nThe training process bakes the task-specific behavior into the custom model. This means your prompts no longer need to include elaborate instructions and examples designed to guide a general purpose model to perform the desired task. Instead, your prompts only need to include the specific input you'd like to handle, reducing the amount of text that gets processed and decreasing latency.\nOne potential safety risk of large language models is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to Jurassic-2 to generate text for their malicious purposes. Adversaries may attempt to achieve this via \u201cprompt injection\u201d, where the end-user\u2019s input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. Custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production.

As the new generation following\nJurassic-1\n, J2 not only improves upon the previous series in every aspect, but it also offers new features and capabilities that put it in a league of its own.\nThe Jurassic-2 series includes both base language models alongside instruction-tuned language models that come in different sizes. You can use all of these models via our\nComplete API\n. Our base models are available in three sizes:\nJurassic-2 Jumbo: Unmatched quality\nAs the largest and most powerful model in the Jurassic series, J2-Jumbo is an ideal choice for the most complex language processing tasks and generative text applications. Further, the model can be fine-tuned for optimum performance in any custom application.\nJurassic-2 Grande: Optimal balance of quality, speed, and cost\nThis model offers enhanced text generation capabilities, making it well-suited to language tasks with a greater degree of complexity. Its fine-tuning options allow for optimization of quality, while maintaining an affordable price and high efficiency.\nJurassic-2 Large: Fast and cost-effective\nDesigned for fast responses, this model can be fine-tuned to optimize performance for relatively simple tasks, making it an ideal choice for language processing tasks that require maximum affordability and less processing power.\nAll of J2 models support several non-English languages, including:\nSpanish\nFrench\nGerman\nPortuguese\nItalian\nDutch\nAll J2 models were trained on a massive corpus of text, making them highly versatile general purpose text-generators, capable of composing human-like text and solving complex tasks such as question answering, text classification and many others.\nJ2 models can be applied to virtually any language task by crafting a suitable prompt, containing a description of the task and/or a few examples, a process commonly known as\nprompt engineering\n. Popular use-cases include generating marketing copy, powering chatbots and assisting creative writing.\nWith trial and error, you should be able to bootstrap a prompt that produces good results for your use-case. However, to achieve even better quality and scale-up your app, we recommend that you train a\ncustom model\nYou can generate a text completion for a given text prompt by using our Python SDK or posting an HTTP request to the complete endpoint corresponding to the desired language model to use. The request contains the input text, called a prompt and various parameters controlling the generation. For authentication, you must include your API key in the request headers. A complete response contains the tokenized prompt, the generated text(s), called completion(s), and various metadata.\nThe request and response specifications are documented in full\nhere\n.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\n\ud83e\udd96 Jurassic-2 Series\nSupported Languages\n\ud83e\udd14 What are they good for?\n\ud83e\udd16 Generate text using Complete API", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/jurassic-2-models"}, {"title": "Instruct Models", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nGetting Started\nOverview\nQuickstart\nKey Concepts\nLarge Language Models\nTokenizer & Tokenization\nWhen Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?\nSampling From Language Models\nPrompt Engineering\nAdvanced\nSpecial Tokens and Whitespaces\nRepetition Penalties\nLogit Bias\nFoundation Models\nJurassic-2 Models\nCustom Models\nJurassic-1 Models [Legacy]\nTask-Specific APIs\nTask-Specific APIs Overview\nParaphrase API\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nText Improvements API\nSummarize API\nText Segmentation API\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nHow To...\nBuild a Dataset\nDatasets: Best Practices\nGenerating More Data Using AI21 Studio\nTips: Building a Dataset\nTrain a Custom Model\nTips: Training a Custom Model\nQuery your Custom Model\nWorking with amazon sagemaker\nPython SDK - with Amazon SageMaker\nChoosing the Right Instance Type\nUsage\nResponsible Use\nSafety Research\nInstruct Models\nBased on our base models from the Jurassic-2 series, Jurassic-2 Instruct were trained specifically to handle instructions-only prompts (\"zero-shot\") without examples (\"few-shot\"). It is the most natural way to interact with large language models, and it is the best way to get a sense of the optimal output for your task without any examples.\nBelow is an example of the difference between Jurassic-2 Instruct and Jurassic-2 Grande to a zero-shot prompt. Jurassic-2 Grande, our base model, starts with a relevant answer but doesn't stop in time (since it wasn't trained specifically to follow instructions).\nJurassic-2 Grande\nprompt:\nWrite a tweet about the future of NLP:\n\ncompletion:\nWe want to know what you think NLP will be like in 10 years.\nSend a tweet to @iNLP Center or @iNLPTech with the hashtag #NLPFuture: Tell us what NLP will be like in 10 years.\nTag one friend to do the same: The person you tag will be entered into a drawing to win a free gift.\n1. Tweet: 10 years from now, what will NLP be like?\n2. Tag a friend: The person you tag will be entered into a drawing to win a free gift.\n3. Tweet: I tagged @JohnSmith.\n4. Tag another friend: The person you tag will be entered into a drawing to win a free gift.\n5. Tweet: I tagged @JaneDoe.\nWhile Jurassic-2 Instruct provides a better answer for the instruction provided:\nJurassic-2 Instruct\nprompt:\nWrite a tweet about the future of NLP:\n\ncompletion:\nThe future of NLP is bright. Using NLP, we can train machines to understand language, reason about knowledge, and interact with humans naturally. #END\nThe following are some best practices for using our Instruct models, as well as examples that show their capabilities.\nIt's important to make sure the instruction ends in a clear way, whether with a punctuation mark (such as \".\", \":\", \"?\" or a newline) or through clear wording.\nIn this case, the prompt ended mid-sentence. As a result, the model completed the instruction itself instead of providing an appropriate response.\nDON'T - instruction doesn't end clearly\nprompt:\ngenerate a weather forecast including the following details:\n1. the high temperatures will reach 25C\n2. the winds will be 100 knots NW\n\ncompletion:\n3. the weather will be cloudy\nThe same prompt is given here, with the following addition at the end to ensure the model understands the instruction:\nDO - instruction ends clearly\nprompt:\ngenerate a weather forecast including the following details:\n1. the high temperatures will reach 25C\n2. the winds will be 100 knots NW\nmake it in a formal tone:\n\ncompletion:\nThe weather forecast for Thursday, April 7, calls for high temperature reaching 25C, with a wind speed of 100 knots.\nWould you like your completions written in a particular style? All you have to do is ask. As an example, here is the same prompt from before, but with the request to write like a pirate.\nLike a pirate\nprompt:\ngenerate a weather forecast including the following details:\n1. the high temperatures will reach 25C\n2. the winds will be 100 knots NW\nmake it in a style of a pirate:\n\ncompletion:\nAhoy! Batten down the hatches! High winds are ahead! High temperatures will reach 25C, and winds will reach 100 knots from the NW.\nYou may get results in different formats if you write a general instruction. For example, the model can list things numbered or separated by dots.\nSeparated by punctuations\nprompt:\nlist 3 active NBA players, include their team and their total career points.\n\ncompletion:\n1.

James Harden, Houston Rockets: 20,143 point. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers: 32,364 points.\nYou can ask specifically for a bullet list:\nBullet list\nprompt:\nlist 3 active NBA players, include their team and their total career points. Do it in a bullet list.\n\ncompletion:\n- LeBron James - Los Angeles Lakers - 35,000+ points\n- Stephen Curry - Golden State Warriors - 20,000+ points\n- Kevin Durant - Brooklyn Nets - 23,000+ points\nOr a JSON format:\nNumbered list\nprompt:\nlist 3 active NBA players, include their team and their total career points.

For example, here is a\nbrief\nprompt:\nWrite a brief history about the war between Pokemons and Digimons.\n\ncompletion:\nThe war between Pokemons and Digimons was fought between the two most powerful species in the Digital World. The Pokemons were led by their king, Ash Ketchum, while the Digimons were led by their king, Agumon. The war lasted for many weeks, with neither side being able to gain the upper hand. Eventually, Ash was able to defeat Agumon and bring peace to the Digital World.\nIn oppose to a\nlong\nhistory:\nprompt:\nWrite a long history about the war between Pokemons and Digimons.\n\ncompletion:\nPokemons and Digimons have always been rivals. They compete for territory, food, and other resources. The Pokemons are considered more powerful, but the Digimons are more intelligent.\nThe war between Pokemons and Digimons began thousands of years ago. The Pokemons were living on the island of Johto, and the Digimons were living on the island of Digiworld. The Pokemons wanted to expand their territory, so they invaded Digiworld. The Digimons fought back, but they were no match for the Pokemons.\nThe Pokemons eventually won, and they took control of Digiworld. The Digimons were forced to leave their homes, and they were forced to live in hiding.\nThe war between Pokemons and Digimons continued for centuries. The Pokemons kept expanding their territory, and the Digimons kept trying to fight back. However, the Pokemons were always victorious.\nIn modern times, the war has mostly stopped. The Pokemons and the Digimons have come to an agreement to live in peace. However, there are still some tensions between them.\nThe war between Pokemons and Digimons has been one of the most important conflicts in human history. It has led to the development of new technologies, and it has shaped the world we live in today.\nNote: adjusting the length through an instruction is not always successful.\nA few good prompt examples for inspiration are provided below.\nBelow is an example of a news release with a specific tone:\nprompt:\nWrite a news release in the voice of a global banking conglomerate announcing an unprecedented building campaign to expand and rebuild their corporate headquarters in Alpha Centauri.\n\ncompletion:\nAlpha Centauri, our home for countless generations, is in trouble. After years of neglect, the banking conglomerate that owns it has been forced into a massive rebuilding campaign.\n\nOur headquarters, which once served as a beacon of hope to the many worlds in our galaxy, is now little more than a crumbling ruin. If we are going to save Alpha Centauri, we must act quickly.\n\nThat is why, for the first time since its foundation, the banking conglomerate is undertaking a building campaign. We are expanding and rebuilding our corporate headquarters, and doing so using the most advanced technologies at our disposal.\nA summary extraction from a chat conversation with a customer:\nprompt:\nFollowing is a transcript of a conversation between a customer and our agent.\n\"\"\"\nCustomer: Hi, I would like to know about your sneakers\nAgent: Hi, I'm Mary, Shoe-La-La's online customer representative!

The company is building a software-as-a-service platform for the food industry so that they can track the environmental impact of each of their products in their lineup. The platform can be used as a basis for eco ratings.\n\nWhile there are quite a few carbon accounting startups like Greenly, Sweep, Persefoni and Watershed, Carbon Maps isn\u2019t an exact competitor as it doesn\u2019t calculate a company\u2019s carbon emissions as a whole. It doesn\u2019t focus on carbon emissions exclusively either. Carbon Maps focuses on the food industry and evaluates the environmental impact of products \u2014 not companies.\n\nCo-founded by Patrick Asdaghi, Je\u0301re\u0301mie Wainstain and Estelle Huynh, the company managed to raise a seed round with Breega and Samaipata \u2014 these two VC firms already invested in Asdaghi\u2019s previous startup, FoodCh\u00e9ri.\n\n\nFoodCh\u00e9ri is a full-stack food delivery company that designs its own meals and sells them directly to end customers with an important focus on healthy food. It also operates Seazon, a sister company for batch deliveries. The startup was acquired by Sodexo a few years ago.\n\n\u201cOn the day that I left, I started working on food and health projects again,\u201d Asdaghi told me. \u201cI wanted to make an impact, so I started moving up the supply chain and looking at agriculture.\u201d\n\nAnd the good news is that Asdaghi isn\u2019t the only one looking at the supply chain of the food industry. In France, some companies started working on an eco-score with a public agency (ADEME) overseeing the project. It\u2019s a life cycle assessment that leads to a letter rating from A to E.\n\nWhile very few brands put these letters on their labels, chances are companies that have good ratings will use the eco-score as a selling point in the coming years.\n\n\nBut these ratings could become even more widespread as regulation is still evolving.

This is accomplished by adding a bias term to each token's respective logits. Where a positive bias increases the generation probability, a negative bias decreases it.\nNote that logit bias operates at the token level, so you must refer to valid tokens in the Jurassic-1 vocabulary, otherwise the API returns an error. Watch out for whitespaces, which are replaced with a special underscore character in our string representation of tokens (see\nhere\n).\nThe following example introduces a large negative bias to avoid generating the expected continuation \"a box of\":\n\ud83d\udc36\nLogit bias example\nOpen Recipe\nUpdated\n9 days ago\nTable of Contents\n\ud83d\udc36 What is it?\nExample", "link": "https://docs.ai21.com/docs/logit-bias"}, {"title": "Repetition Penalties", "text": "Jump to Content\nGo to Playground\nAPI Key\nAccount\nLog In\nHome\nGuides\nRecipes\nAPI Reference\nChangelog\nSearch\nGetting Started\nOverview\nQuickstart\nKey Concepts\nLarge Language Models\nTokenizer & Tokenization\nWhen Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?\nSampling From Language Models\nPrompt Engineering\nAdvanced\nSpecial Tokens and Whitespaces\nLogit Bias\nFoundation Models\nJurassic-2 Models\nInstruct Models\nCustom Models\nJurassic-1 Models [Legacy]\nTask-Specific APIs\nTask-Specific APIs Overview\nParaphrase API\nGrammatical Error Corrections API\nText Improvements API\nSummarize API\nText Segmentation API\nContextual Answers API [BETA]\nHow To...\nBuild a Dataset\nDatasets: Best Practices\nGenerating More Data Using AI21 Studio\nTips: Building a Dataset\nTrain a Custom Model\nTips: Training a Custom Model\nQuery your Custom Model\nWorking with amazon sagemaker\nPython SDK - with Amazon SageMaker\nChoosing the Right Instance Type\nUsage\nResponsible Use\nSafety Research\nRepetition Penalties\nRepetition penalties can be used to counteract the model's tendency to repeat prompt text verbatim and/or get stuck in a loop. This is accomplished by adjusting the token probabilities at each generation step, such that tokens that already appeared in the text (either in the prompt or in the completion) are less likely to be generated again.\nThere are three types of repetition penalties:\npresencePenalty\ncountPenalty\nfrequencyPenalty\n. One or more penalties can be used, and the magnitude of each can be controlled independently.\nUsed to reduce the probability of generating new tokens that appear at least once in the prompt or in the completion. As an example, if your prompt (and current completion) is\nwill decrease (by the same value), even though that\nappears more than the others.\nUsed to reduce the probability of generating new tokens that appear at least once in the prompt or in the completion, in proportion to the number of appearances. As an example, if your prompt (and current completion) is\n\"One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish\"\n, the probability of the tokens\n\"One\"\n\"two\"\n\"red\"\n, and\n\"blue\"\nwill decrease by some value and the probability of the token\n\"fish\"\nwill decrease by a larger value.\nReduce the probability of generating new tokens that appear in the prompt or in the completion, in proportion to the frequency of their appearances in the text (normalized to text length). Using this method is beneficial in longer texts, since repeating some words is less of an issue than it is in short texts.\nThe following example introduces all three penalties simultaneously (though each one individually would have sufficed to prevent repetition):\nRepetition penalties\nIn addition to controlling the penalty scale, the API allows penalties to be toggled on and off for five special categories of tokens: whitespaces (including newlines), punctuations, numbers, stopwords (including multi-word combinations of stopwords) and emojis. For example:\n\ud83e\udd10\nRepetition penalties - special tokens\nOpen Recipe\nEach repetition penalty is characterized by a PenaltyData data structure containing the following fields:\nscale |\nfloat\nControls the magnitude of the penalty.\nRequired\nA positive penalty value implies reducing the probability of repetition.

Instead of merely using punctuation and newlines to divide the text, this identifies distinct topics and lines that will work well together and will form a coherent piece of text.\nThis API supports up to 100,000 characters, which translates to roughly 20,000 words, or 80 pages! This can be used, for example, to segment long text into smaller chunks and summarize each segment separately.\nSee full Text Segmentation API reference\nhere\nIn addition to working with free text, this API can also work directly with your favorite (or least favorite) webpage URLs! No need to spend time and effort scraping text yourself - just input the required URL and let the summarization begin.\nNote: if the webpage you are trying to summarize is behind a paywall or restricted access, your call will fail and will result in an error.\nThis API is really helpful when you have long text to process and you have some length limitations in your flow. Following are some examples illustrating both use cases and special features you can take advantage of with this API.\nIf you want to summarize long texts, you may encounter an issue: the Summarize API is limited to 50,000 characters. You can use the Segmentation API for texts twice as long (100,000 characters).\nThe example below shows a typical flow for summarizing texts longer than Summarize APIs character limit. First, we call Segmentation and get a list of segments. Second, we iterate through the list and perform a Summarize call to summarize each segment. We print the summaries in order to form a summary of the entire document.\nImagine that we want to summarize the Wikipedia page on\nTom Brady\n.

It has been specifically developed for reading long texts and providing a faithful summary of the original document. This is also the engine behind\nWordtune Read\n- our acclaimed reading assistant, so you know it's pretty awesome.\nundefined\nWhether you're an NLP enthusiast or have no prior knowledge, this API is for you. There are many clever mechanisms under the hood, but you don't have to understand them (if you don't want to). As a summarize-specific API, you can easily integrate it into your systems and get top-notch summarizations in a matter of minutes, with no prompt engineering required. Additionally, since it's optimized for this purpose, it's significantly more efficient than building it from scratch, and an order of magnitude cheaper.\nThis API takes a piece of text or fetches text from a given URL and generates grounded summaries that remain faithful to the original document (i.e. no external information is added during the process). The summaries are formatted as bullet lists, following the original text flow.\nSummaries are returned as a single string, containing bullet points representing the key points of your text.\nThe input text should contain at least 40\nwords\nand no more than 50,000\ncharacters\n. This translates to roughly 10,000 words, or an impressive 40 pages! When it comes to URLs, this limitation only applies for summarizable text (after parsing, preprocessing, etc.).\nIn addition to working with free text, this API can also work directly with your favorite (or least favorite) webpage URLs! No need to spend time and effort scraping text yourself - just input the required URL and let the summarization begin.\nNote: if the webpage you are trying to summarize is behind a paywall or restricted access, your call will fail and will result in an error.\nSave your users time by providing focused summaries on a topic of their choice with our enhanced guided summary feature. By specifying keywords, phrases, or topics, the API will produce only the relevant summaries, allowing your users faster browsing and better text consumption.\nWith just a few lines of code, you can provide your users with high quality summaries and highlights. Whether they are students who need to perform a massive literature review, journalists who need to sift through large amounts of information, or your average Joe who just needs to get the gist of the long report they have to read. Following are some examples illustrating both use cases and special features you can take advantage of with this API.\nKeeping up with world events is important, but with the current information overload, who has the time?\nWith our Summarize API, you can provide your users with the highlights of various news articles, letting them choose what they want to read more about.\nAs an example, below is a summary of a single news item.\nThe error affected a number of international flights leaving the terminal on Wednesday, with some airlines urging passengers to travel only with hand luggage.\nVirgin Atlantic said all airlines flying out of the terminal had been affected.\nPassengers have been warned it may be days before they are reunited with luggage.\nAn airport spokesperson apologised and said the fault had now been fixed.\nVirgin Atlantic said it would ensure all bags were sent out as soon as possible.\nIt added customers should retain receipts for anything they had bought and make a claim to be reimbursed.\nPassengers, who were informed by e-mail of the problem, took to social media to vent their frustrations.\nOne branded the situation \"ludicrous\" and said he was only told 12 hours before his flight.\nThe airport said it could not confirm what the problem was, what had caused it or how many people had been affected.\nA number of international flights were affected by the error on Wednesday, with some airlines urging passengers to travel only with hand luggage. Passengers were informed by e-mail of the problem and took to social media to vent their frustrations.\nThe number of papers coming out every year makes keeping track difficult. Our Summarize API lets your users stay up-to-date with current academic advancements, so that they can focus on their work and not spend all their time reading research papers.\nAs an example, below is a summary of the landmark paper\nAttention Is All You Need\n:\nOriginal text\nThe dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or  convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data\nSummary\nThe Transformer is a new simple network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. It achieves superior results on two machine translation tasks, including a new single-model state-of-the-art score of 41.8 BLEU.\nIf you want to summarize long texts, you may encounter an issue: the Summarize API is limited to 50,000 characters. You can use the Segmentation API for texts twice as long (100,000 characters).\nThe example below shows a typical flow for summarizing texts longer than Summarize APIs character limit. First, we call Segmentation and get a list of segments. Second, we iterate through the list and perform a Summarize call to summarize each segment. We print the summaries in order to form a summary of the entire document.\nImagine that we want to summarize the Wikipedia page on\nTom Brady\n. The following call to the Summarize API will result in an error:\nPython\nresponse = ai21.Summarize.execute(\n    source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady\",\n    sourceType='URL')\n\n// error returned: Input text exceeds max characters limit: 50000\nHowever, with the Segmentation API you will get the text divided to segments:\nResponse\n{\n   \"id\":\"33ce4604-19ac-3479-0971-c37103869419\",\n   \"segments\":[\n      {\n         \"segmentText\":\"This article is about the American football player.
