"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8

"Language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8

"Certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.Weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-amazon-partnership,8

"Transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - “Was Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?”. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation.

"Discover how Verb.ai used AI21 Studio to create a revolutionary writing tool for authors, improving brainstorming and expression. Read the case study now.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"According to a New York Times article, 81 percent of Americans feel they have a book in them that they should write. Now, it may be an old statistic, but mankind’s desire to share stories has been around since the dawn of time as a way to share empathy, connection, and entertainment. So, it surely isn’t leaving human nature anytime soon.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"But at the risk of stating the obvious: writing a book is hard. In fact, the writer of the aforementioned article, an author of 14 books, says “without attempting to overdo the drama of the difficulty of writing … composing a book is almost always to feel oneself in a state of confusion, doubt and mental imprisonment.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Yeah, it’s a lot of hard work.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"So how did AI21 Studio help Verb, an AI-enhanced tool for fiction writers, create a cutting-edge application designed to help writers and hobbyists alike complete their novels without all the hassle and uncertainty?",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"We spoke to Ryan Bowman, publishing and creative writing veteran and part of Verb’s small team of founders, to find out how AI21 Studio was a key to such creative writing success.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
Forging the Way toward a New Creative AI Tool,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Verb is a writing tool that helps make completing long-form narratives – novels for now but later films, TV shows, even video games – faster, easier, and more fun. It does so by assisting with all key stages of creation: brainstorming, writing, and editing. But all that wasn’t plausible until they found the perfect Language Learning Model (LLM). Let’s dive in further.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
Use Case #1: Brainstorming Plot Points,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"As we saw in the New York Times quote above, keeping an entire story straight inside your head can be a lot of work. As anyone who’s tried to write long-form anything knows, it can get messy, convoluted, jumbled, and sometimes, uninspiring.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"“They say novel writing is a group activity done by yourself,” Ryan tells us. “So one of Verb’s jobs is to be that other person, that brainstorm partner.” That’s why they set out to create one of their most important – and as it soon turned out, most popular – functions inside of their app: brainstorming. This feature allows you to plan the novel scene by scene, chapter by chapter.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
That type of brainstorming could look like the following:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
You write: “Ben is sitting in his office and a woman appears next door.”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,7
You click: “Suggest a plot point”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,7
AI generates: “The woman pulls out a gun and chases him through the hallway.”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,7
"Then, you can either:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Run with that idea in your scene and use it as the next plot point, or",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,7
Continue clicking the “What happens next” button to generate more ideas until you find one that sparks your imagination and helps you continue.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,7
"An incredibly useful tool for writers, it’s been something that keeps these authors coming back for more. “One of the most amazing findings we’ve seen,” adds Ryan, “is that the more you use what makes Verb special - AI features like plot planning, the more likely you are to come back and write.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
Use Case #2: Writing Literary Language,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Generative AI models are incredibly diverse, and capable of outputting new content, summaries, translations, answers to questions, and more. But one thing they haven’t been able to do just yet is write literary works. That’s to say, these AI models can create – but they’re not necessarily creative.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"“We needed to build tools that are specific to the problems of a novelist. It couldn’t be just about generating text,” Ryan explains, noting that Verb knew the AI model they were to use must be able to generate discursive literary language.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"“Language Learning Models (LLM) are not natural storytellers,” says Ryan, going on to explain how much storytelling is a learned craft; something that must be practiced for years in order to call it a skill. “There is 2,000 years of literary and practical theory backing up the idea that telling stories is hard – important and necessary but difficult.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Luckily, Ryan and the team at Verb found the literary solution they needed in AI21 Studio. “When generating texts for our users who are looking for more discursive, more literary, more discriminating language, AI21 turned out to have a good tone and feel,” he says.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Use Case #3: Fine-Tuning, Iterations & Customer Support",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"One of the critical tasks of validating generative models is having criteria. To validate the reliability of this sort of generative AI effectively, you still need human involvement – especially when creating something brand new to the market.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"How’d Verb achieve this? Verb built a platform that tests generative output amongst thousands of judgments across multiple writing professionals. These individuals look at different paragraphs of literary texts and decide which ones they like better, which ultimately helps Verb build a gradient of quality.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"“We keep trying and testing and building iterations on top,” says Ryan, noting that they are always adding options to see which ones humans prefer. “As crazy as it sounds, we are in the process of teaching it literary theory.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Along the same lines, it’s important to note that creating something so new to the market doesn’t just call for multiple iterations but also gathers support from everyone involved.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"“We’re in a world of newness,” Ryan laments. “There is nothing like [Verb] so we’re not always sure what we’re supposed to be doing – it is freeing and slightly frightening at the same time.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Ryan and the team at Verb knew they needed a company that could see in their vision – which is when they turned to AI21 Studio. “We found working with AI21 to be a breath of fresh air,” says Ryan, noting that it felt like a collaboration done with real human faces they can interact with for guidance, assistance, and ideas – rather than a business-client relationship.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"The Results: More Authors Finishing their Novels, Faster",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"The self-publishing landscape of 2022 shows that indie writers are becoming the new norm. But AI has been an alleged threat to writers since its inception, leading many people to believe that writers wouldn’t even want the help of an AI-enhanced tool to get them across the finish line.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"So, of course, Verb also has to ask themselves the question: Are writers really interested in having a machine collaborator help them with their creative writing? “Our early data says that they are,” says Ryan, noting that since launching its alpha version using AI21 Studio, Verb has seen a dramatic uptake of this experimental tool.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"Not to mention, as we saw with the brainstorming feature, the more creative and collaborative the model, the more likely writers are to stick around the app.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"In fact, Ryan confirms that there are a dozen or so authors (out of an intimate group of alpha users) who have done the hardest task – actually finishing their book! – stating that Verb helped them do just that.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6
"With Verb, and the help of AI21 Studio, it can be done. Dare we say – it can be done faster, easier, and with more fun.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6

"With the pairing of new tools such as Verb with custom models from AI21 Studio, generative AI has evolved from just helping individuals generate text to something much more intertwined with the human love of storytelling; an AI tool that is not a threat to writers but actually a collaborator, a copy editor, a creative director, and even a confidante for inspired wordsmiths around the world.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,6

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarize-api-outperforms-openais-models,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarize-api-outperforms-openais-models,8

What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarize-api-outperforms-openais-models,8

"Learn how Ubisoft utilizes AI21 Labs to automate tedious tasks and enhance their game creation process, all while maintaining their creative vision.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
About Ubisoft,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
This video game titan doesn’t need an introduction. But for the uninitiated:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Ubisoft is the creator of Assassin's Creed, Just Dance, Watch Dogs, and multiple other incredibly well-crafted and popular video games. They were one of the first brands to invent rich, immersive, story-driven gaming worlds—back in the early 1980s.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"The company was founded on the principles of embracing human creativity and grew to rapid popularity by the early 90s. Always ahead of the curve, Ubisoft built their first AI gaming lab 6 years ago.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
The story,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
The script writers' work at the company is the cornerstone of the complex artifact that is a narrative driven game.  They create diverse and interactive elements - from sequential in-game cinematics to procedurally generated crowd chatter.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"We talked to Ben Swanson, research scientist at Ubisoft about the challenges they were facing and how A121 helped.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Why AI21 Labs? Creator-friendly vision, ready-to-use models, and legal compliance.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
Ubisoft and AI21 Labs share a common vision: create tools to automate tedious tasks so writers can focus on creative pursuits.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“Our writers do excellent work. We want to assist them with whatever tools and models that we can.” says Swanson. AI21 Labs’s Wordtune has a similar philosophy. This vision and passion for the possibilities of human-machine collaborative writing stood out to Ubisoft in their search for a reliable large language model.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“We’ve been leading towards AI21 Labs because we’ve had positive internal reviews from team members who’ve worked with AI21 Labs previously.”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Also, Ubisoft utilized AI21 Labs’s vanilla model from the get-go. Very often, with LLMs, companies need a lot of customization and fine-tuning, but AI21’s model was a perfect fit for Ubisoft’s data augmentation needs. The intuitive API made the integration even easier.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Finally, AI21 went the extra mile by ironing out legal compliance issues that have been a point of contention in other LLM partnerships.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"With a model-usage fit and shared values, Ubisoft set out to enhance their game-creation process with AI21.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
repetitive manual work for video game writers,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
The first challenge:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,7
One of the many different tasks that goes into scriptwriting is writing bark trees which are standalone NPC lines that require as many variations as possible (and allowed by the voiceover budget). Each of these groups of variations can be seen as responses to a shared motivation.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"For example, if the motivation is hunger, the character might say “let’s order pizza.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
Simply paraphrasing “let’s order pizza” wouldn’t work in this case.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“There's only so much you can do with paraphrasing. You actually have to pivot through the motivation or start from the motivation.” says Ben.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Ubisoft saw the value AI21 brought to the game development process. Instead of having to painstakingly brainstorm 5-10 different ways to express motivation (hunger, in this example), Ubisoft’s internal models could use AI21’s output as a launch pad.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“It lets our writers hit the ground running. It's an Inspiration tool for them. It's a way for them to overcome writer’s block.” says Swanson.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6

need for data augmentation,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
The second challenge:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,7
"To create an engine for automatic paraphrasing, Ubisoft had to use internal models. And to reliably use internal models, they needed fine tuning data (which didn’t exist). If they’d tasked humans with creating this fine-tuning data, it would have taken an eternity.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“So we use AI21 to suggest data of the correct form. It’s easier for writers to thumbs up and edit or thumbs down than to come up with novel and diverse training data themselves.” says Ben.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"With AI21, Ubisoft could generate thousands of inputs and hand-pick the best ones to edit using their fine tuning datasets. With this augmented data set, the outputs became more diverse, and distinctive.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
Ubisoft embeds the NPC generator and other similar models they’ve trained into the writing tools for their scripters. The writers are shown pairwise comparisons of outputs so the models can get further trained through human feedback.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“Before AI21 we wouldn’t do this manually — we weren’t doing it at all. It was THAT tedious. “ says Swanson. “What we unlocked by our partnership with AI21 is an unlimited fountain of training data of whatever precise format we require!”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
rising costs of in-context learning (data augmentation),https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
The third challenge:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,7
"With an unlimited fountain of training data, the next challenge was that of escalating data augmentation costs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
Most LLM brands charge based on both input and output tokens.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"With a 30:1 input to output ratio, Ubisoft successfully optimized their budget for game creation.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
This created an obstacle: Ubisoft wanted to fine-tune the outputs to the minutest detail so their writers would work on high-quality suggestions. This meant experimenting with multiple prompts which would cost them significantly more money.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
AI21 customized their pricing model to aid Ubisoft in their vision: top-notch AI-generated recommendations so writers have more inspiration (and lesser manual work). AI21 charged them only for output tokens.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
“AI21's pricing model at that time was the best for data augmentation.” adds Ben.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
What changed for Ubisoft after working with AI21?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"“The win here is rapid scaling. When it comes to writing a game, there's a tremendous amount of tedious work. For example, there need to be 10-15 different ways for a townsperson to “get out of here” — or it’s going to sound repetitive.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Writers often talk about having an editing brain and a writing brain — the writing brain requires you to conjure something from nothing. The editing brain is where you polish it. So if you can jump to the editing step, that's huge.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"“That's the promise of AI21: quality data augmentation outputs"",says Ben.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
The road forward,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Over a third of our conversation with Ubisoft was future-facing. Because of both teams' synchronicity, capabilities, and common beliefs, there are dozens of use cases to be built. Here’s what Ubisoft is most excited about:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"Building a statistical reference model for video games engineered from AI21 Labs’s generative AI capabilities: Ubisoft’s vision to design creator-inspired, immersive games helps them build worlds with rich history, depth of character, and dramatic storylines. AI21 Labs plans to document these complex worlds to offer stats and facts to players on command.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"“The nice thing about AI21’s setup (as opposed to the kind of LLM usage in video games you often see these days where it's basically just a chatbot) is that our setup leverages LLMs in a writer-in-the-loop scenario.  Additionally, as it relies on data augmentation and fine tuning, it allows writers to compose their own I/O - keeping it as a tool for them rather than a lower-quality replacement.” says Ben.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6
"At AI21, not only are we thrilled to bring Ubisoft’s vision for innovation to life, but we are thrilled about the opportunities for contributing to a creator-first world.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,6

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8

However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8

What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language.

However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more.

"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge.

"Transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - “Was Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?”. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X’s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2,8

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2,8

Transparency and trust,https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2,8
"Transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - “Was Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?”. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X’s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2,8

How to choose the right instance type in Amazon SageMaker,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/choosing-the-right-instance-type-for-amazon-sagemaker-models,13
"Each of our models can be run in multiple instances. When you have decided on a model, choosing the right instance is mainly a matter of economics. Depending on your use case, you probably want the most cost-effective instance possible.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/choosing-the-right-instance-type-for-amazon-sagemaker-models,11
"Our large language models support a context window of up to 8191 tokens. In large language models the context window refers to the limited amount of tokens the model considers when generating a response. The context window acts as a threshold for the amount of tokens in the prompt and the completion, namely: prompt + completion <= context window. As an estimate for your use-case: the average token size in our tokenizer is six characters. You can also check any text you want using our /tokenize API.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/choosing-the-right-instance-type-for-amazon-sagemaker-models,11
"Note: Not all instances are available in all regions. Also, ml.p4de being in preview, and you need to ask from Amazon SageMaker access.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/choosing-the-right-instance-type-for-amazon-sagemaker-models,11

Usage Guidelines,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,12
AI21 Studio must not be used for any of the following activities:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,13
"Illegal activities, such as hate speech, gambling, child pornography or violating intellectual property rights;",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,14
"Harassment, victimization, intimidation, fraud or spam;",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,14
"Creation or dissemination of misinformation, promotion of self-harm, glorification of violent events or incitement of violence.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,14
"Your application may present content generated by AI21 Studio directly to humans (e.g., chatbots, content generation tools, etc). In this case, you are required to ensure the following:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,13
No content generated by AI21 Studio will be posted automatically (without human intervention) to any public website or platform where it may be viewed by an audience greater than 100 people.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,15
"This means that you can use AI21 Studio to build a bot for your team’s 7-person Slack channel. In contrast, you are not allowed to build a Twitter bot, unless each tweet is checked by a human before it is posted. You can build a customer service bot that interacts with any number of customers, assuming it's chatting with each human separately in a 1:1 conversation.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,16
"In any case, the first human to view text generated by AI21 Studio must not be led to believe that it was written by a human.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,15
"If you’re building a copywriting tool for marketing professionals, your users must be informed that the text proposed to them is machine generated. They are then free to use and present it as their own, at their discretion. As another example, if you’re building a chatbot, it must be clear to your users that they are corresponding with a machine rather than a live human.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,16
"Language models such as those accessible via AI21 Studio may generate inappropriate, biased, offensive or otherwise harmful content (see our technical paper for an evaluation of bias in our models). If your application is used by more than 100 people per month, you must provide a method for users to report generated text as harmful. You should monitor these reports and respond to them appropriately.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/responsible-use,15

How Easyway Uses AI-Powered Chat to Automate Communication for Luxury Hotels,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Learn how Easyway, a guest relationship management platform, used AI21 Labs LLM to streamline their operation and improve guest communications.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"A luxury hotel that wants to provide exceptional hospitality must deliver a 5-star experience throughout the guest's entire journey, from the moment they arrive on the website until they check out.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
But how can these hotels give personalized attention to guests with 200 and more messages a day without relying on gimmicky chatbots?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Asaf Ofer, CTO and Founder of Easyway, discussed their current use of AI and how he plans to scale it.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
What is Easyway?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Easyway is a guest relationship management platform (GRM) that facilitates two-way communication between guests and the hotel through instant messaging apps such as Whatsapp, SMS, Telegram, and more.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Using their technology, hotels are able to automate communication and streamline daily operations like check-in and check-out processes.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Since Easyway serves mostly luxury hotels that cater to a 4- and 5-star experience, every touchpoint is crucial for delivering high-end customer service. Aiming to improve certain aspects of their platform, they turned to AI21 Labs to take their product to a new level.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
Why They Chose AI21: An LLM Solution that Mimics Human Interaction,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,7
"Since Easyway isn't a chatbot, but rather an AI-powered chat platform, they needed a solution that wasn't readily available on the market. They looked for an AI platform with enough scientific and engineering innovation to be able to understand and generate natural text.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"“The guest needs to feel like they're speaking to a human and not a chatbot,” says Asaf. “If we automate it in a human and customized way, hotels need less staff, and people feel like they're being treated like special guests every time.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
The Problem with Other Models on the Market,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Easyway started out using other models that could answer common questions, but only if those questions were asked in the most common and simple form. A slight deviation would cause the entire model to fail.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"“People had questions that it didn’t know how to respond to, because it never saw these questions [asked this way] before,” Asaf explains. “Sometimes it was wrongly confident about what was being asked because it didn't get a lot of examples to work with.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
AI21’s Personalized Customer Service & Assistance to the Rescue,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,7
"With the assistance of AI21, the Easyway team was able to train their model using a few dozen custom-made prompts. “We had several calls, I showed them our results and they helped me clean up and set up the training data correctly,” says Asaf.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"AI21 helped Asaf’s team break the process down to steps, translate it into code, and find discrepancies in the data. Finally, the Easyway team managed to arrive at their desired solution.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
It was through this level of support that Easyway was able to use AI21 to upgrade their application.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
Use Case #1: Intent Detection,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"With AI21's proprietary Large language Models (LLMs), Easyway was able to analyze intent with high accuracy. Easyway now uses a sentiment analysis model based on fifteen frequently asked questions.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"“We gave the model a question and it gives us back 1 out of several possible intents,” says Asaf. He goes on to explain that if the model doesn’t exactly know that answer, then it’s okay not to respond at all – sometimes, it’s actually better for business not to. That’s due to the fact that inappropriately responding to an already frustrated or angry customer may only fuel the situation rather than alleviating it.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"This feature will lead to even bigger things in the future, says Asaf. “Once we have a reliable solution for detecting sentiment, we’d be able to automate much more - If the system detects that a guest is angry, we could immediately notify the manager. If a guest is satisfied, we’d ask them to leave a review, etc.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
Use Case #2: Automatic Translation,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Every hotel is filled with travelers from and to various countries. The importance of having a staff with multiple languages cannot be overstated. However, knowledge of every language is not always possible, which is why translation apps are useful.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Easyway offers high-quality 2-way translation capabilities in 100+ languages. “A Spanish guest will speak Spanish and the staff will be speaking Hebrew and the conversation will be understandable for each side,” Asaf explains. “So each person can just use their native language, plus we use AI to respond to messages automatically.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"This feature was already in production before Easyway reached out to AI21, but there was much room for improvement. “One of the gaps we had to tackle was a varying level of grammar amongst our end users. The problem involved two aspects; the level of service that our clients provide their guests, and the efficiency of our translation feature. If a person writing on our platform didn’t write properly, the live translation wouldn’t work properly.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"By incorporating the same technology that is used in Wordtune, AI21’s flagship AI writing assistant, this was made possible.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
The Future for Easyway,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"What if you could not only automate away repetitive questions, but also begin to automatically set common responses to FAQs?",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Easyway is currently running a pilot to embed a chat widget on one of their partners’ websites, gearing up for a possible new offer. “We’re [piloting this feature] with a customer in Europe that has a lot of visitors to their website - around 150K each month, and they don't have the staff to deal with it. So they just end up with thousands of emails asking basic questions that nobody responds to,” Asaf says.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"With Easyway, hotels can automate and schedule messages based on events such as booking, arrival, and departure.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
A typical post-booking conversation could be:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"“Hey Asaf, thank you for booking your stay with us. Do you have any questions?”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,7
Asaf may type: “How do I get to the hotel?” or “What are the Covid regulations?”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,7
"The chat platform is set up to respond automatically, helping hotels save time with quality AI.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"The Result: Automated, Human-Centered Conversations that Save Time",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Remember those 200 or more messages we mentioned hotels can receive each day? To reach success, Easyway will look at how many emails each hotel actually needs to personally answer after using their application powered by AI21. Asaf stated that a “10, 20, 30% [reduction rate] would be amazing.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6
"Overall, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our NLP technology to help alleviate the administrative burdens that hotels experience on a daily basis – while still uplifting the 5-star experience guests want from their hotel of choice.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,6

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8

"Language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8

How Harambee built conversational flows to achieve a 20% sign-up increase,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Learn how Harambee used AI21 Labs' custom models to create an NLP chatbot app to onboard job seekers to one of their career programs.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Harambee is the official platform for government bodies wanting to hire youth in South Africa. But when the pandemic hit, they needed to find a low-touch yet incredibly authentic way to connect with the growing number of unemployed youth who were looking to get trained and hired.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Harambee logo,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,7
"So, how was it done? Harambee not only created a new virtual onboarding process, but also drove a 20% conversion rate increase in sign-ups by using AI21 as their Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine. This was achieved by setting up our Language Models to act as intelligent chatbots. The bots were able to understand the context of each conversation, build rapport with the individuals, and respond naturally – guiding them toward their career goals.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"We spoke with Brent Davidoff, who leads Harambee's effort to scale transformative interventions using their omni channel contact center.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Brent Davidoff, Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,7
Who is Harambee?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator is a not-for-profit social enterprise that solves youth employment through partnerships. Harambee works with partners who are also committed to results that can work at scale – including government, the private sector, civil society, and over three million youth. By fusing brilliant minds with best-in-class technology, Harambee is working to unlock jobs and break down the barriers that keep millions of young South Africans unemployed.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
But how they bridge the gap between unemployed with no experience to ready to work and employable is a key reason why Harambee eventually needed AI21 Studio.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Harambee put these youth through a simulation of a workplace that they call the “bridging process”. In it, the individuals report to a manager and are measured on punctuality and soft skills with a scorecard.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"“After three months of daily bridging, they were transformed,” said Brent, noting that employers would always see a positive difference in these young adults after completing the program.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
And then the 2020 pandemic happened.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Pivoting their processes, and turning to NLP during a pandemic",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"The once highly personalized, streamlined work socialization experience was now at risk. “With only 120 personnel at the time, we stopped doing face-to-face processes and didn’t do the bridging anymore,” says Brent.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Like many companies during that time, they went fully remote and launched a new website – SAYouth. And while they still had companies wanting to employ these youths, these individuals weren’t yet ready for the job market. “They were missing the secret sauce [of the bridging process],” adds Brent.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Searching for a Solution that Could Match Human Intelligence,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
This led them to the development of a chatbot that they called “Coachmee”. It created a conversation based learning experience that used evidence-based techniques to effect measurable behavior change in its users. But not without some snags along the way.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"“From our previous work with other chatbots [before finding AI21], we had seen how the signup process was a vital component for ensuring high levels of engagement and most chatbots failed to do that with an audience like ours for a number of reasons,” Brent tells us, explaining why he went searching for a new solution.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Here’s what Harambee needed – and what led them to AI21.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Problem #1: A chatbot that can understand, not just repeat",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Their focus was deeper than simply having quick response times for their customers. Harambee needed help creating trust, rapport, and relationships with their users during their sign-up process – a critical, pivotal moment in their program.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"“Traditional intent-based NLPs are all about understanding what someone says, but then returning something that is prewritten. But no conversation is like that. You must be unique,” says Brent, providing us with an example of an everyday conversation during the sign-up process.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6

Jurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to Wikidata,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,7
Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,8

"There are many models that offer a multitude of language options, but one was missing – what about broken English?",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"There are times when people switch between languages and use a mix of words that would not be understood by a normal chatbot. Our goal isn't just to find something that speaks one of South Africa's 11 official languages, but to find out what someone really is trying to convey.” says Brent.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Why AI21 Studio? Better accessibility and support,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"While we at AI21 have best practices to help mitigate the risk of malicious use of language models, AI21’s barrier to entry was non-existent, meaning Harambee could jump right in.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6

"“I am not a coder,” he adds. “When I saw that AI21 Studio had an easy-to-use fine-tuning feature that did not require any previous coding experience, I was excited to see how quickly I could prototype different conversational flows and build something that felt human and relatable.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Beyond the Chatbot: How Harambee Used AI21 to Reach Their End Goal,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Harambee saw incredible success using the chatbot.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"“The conversations [work seekers are having] are incredible,” says Brent. “For the first time, they feel like they are important. For the first time, they feel like their goals are important. They feel like there is someone there to support them.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Beyond building rapport and genuine connection with the South African youth, they were able to utilize AI21 to make their jobs easier and improve further processes.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Solution #1: Content creation through “lifehacks”,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"With AI copywriting, you can automate repetitive writing tasks. Brent and the Harambee team were able to develop around 60 different ""lifehacks"" for users who had signed up for Coachmee check-in sessions.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Lifehacks have to strike a careful balance between being aspirational and transcendent, while being practical and relevant. All within a few sentences, making sure someone doesn't have to scroll back up to read the full message.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"Another unique contribution of AI21 Labs was around the use of emojis, which enabled the lifehacks to be much more playful and engaging.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
Solution #2: Unique reference letters,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"With the summarization tool, you can compress documents and extract key insights into short summaries. Brent and the Harambee team used this to create 100% unique, relevant reference letters for each individual who finished their training.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"“Sometimes the model can go way too far and make up crazy things about the person,” says Brent, discussing what has gone wrong while using other applications.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6
"“[But] when a user completes 20 check-ins with Coachmee, we have enough data that can factually testify to someone's commitment to growth and goal-achievement. That information, together with the deep insights into their aspirations and personality that we lifted from the initial sign-up conversation, we are able to use Studio API to generate beautiful reference letters that they can attach to their CVs and take with them to interviews,” explains Brent. “I [once] got a message saying, ‘I gotta frame this!’”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,6

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language.

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8

Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more.

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,8

"Model training is not a one-time affair, but an iterative process.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-tricks,13
"We selected the default hyperparameters after testing several benchmarks and choosing those that gave optimal results across the board. Nevertheless, if your trained model doesn't work as expected, you may want to train another version with different hyperparameters.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-tricks,12
Sometimes custom models work better when fed a few-shot prompt. Be sure to perform some calls with few-shot prompts when testing your trained model.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-tricks,12
"There is no guarantee that more epochs will provide a better result. From our experience, this is especially true when you want your model to generate expressive and diverse content. A relatively short training will help retain J-1’s original abilities. Longer training will provide a model that behaves more like the data in your dataset (for good or bad).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-tricks,12
", so if the data has biases, the model will learn the bias. For example, if most of your data begins with the words “I think that”, then the model will learn to give high probability for these words. This can help in debugging the model, so look at the probabilities (using alternative tokens) to understand the biases in the data.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-tricks,12

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them.

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8

"Jurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,7
"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8

Dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates),https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8
"Certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.Weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai,8

Build a CV profile generator using AI21 Studio,https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"In just a few minutes, you can transform an idea into a working and integrated application using AI21 Studio",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"Can a machine automatically generate a paragraph of fluent text? Not so long ago, the answer to this question was ‘No!’. Today, thanks to large language models, practitioners with different levels of expertise can build applications that generate useful text for marketing, content writing and more.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"Hold on tight, because in this blog post we’re going to go from an idea to a completely new text generation feature that you can ship immediately. Ready to get started?",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"Suppose you're building a job marketplace app or a personnel recruitment platform. You probably have a feature that lets candidates upload their CV to your system. Those CVs aren't always stellar. For example, many of them lack a profile section - a short paragraph that highlights the candidate’s background, skills and ambitions. Luckily, you can use AI21 Studio to help your users by auto-generating a CV profile for them. This is just one example of short-form content generation, where language models are used to draft text up to a paragraph long (more examples are in the summary).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
In this post we'll build a CV profile generator that you can integrate into your application or website in just a few minutes of work.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
Step 1: Define the problem,https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"Understanding what kind of text you want to generate is essential. In this case we need to ask ourselves:  what makes a good CV profile that our users will appreciate? Let’s take a look at some examples and try to find ones we like. Here is an article you can find online that shows various types of CV profiles. For example, let’s look at a profile for a chemical engineer:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"I am a dedicated, hardworking and proactive Chemical Engineer with a strong background in design, plant operations, offshore operations, and process and safety improvements. I have solid work experience in designing, testing and analysing processes to increase the overall efficiency of operations. I am currently looking for an opportunity to utilise my technical skills in a challenging working environment and become a valuable asset to the organization that I work for.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,7
"As you can see, it’s a short paragraph that covers the candidates background, experience and the type of role they are looking for. Browsing through more examples, it is clear that most CV profiles follow this pattern. Let’s make a note of a few examples (3-5 will do) that we like. Our goal is to generate texts similar to these examples. Now we are ready to log into the AI21 Studio and start building.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
Step 2: Create your (initial) prompt,https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"Language models take in some text as input and generate some likely continuation of that text. We call the input text the prompt and the generated text the completion. You can think of large language models as smart auto-completion algorithms: they are very good at latching on to hints and patterns expressed in plain English, and generating text that follows the same patterns.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6
"For example, if we input a prompt that is likely to be followed by a CV profile, we can get the model to generate new and original CV profiles as completions. One simple way to do this is to spell out an instruction, just like you would when asking a person to produce some text:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,6

"Mr George Mwangi is a Teacher who has completed Diploma, Degree and Masters Degree in Education. He has vast teaching experience of 7 years. His expertise is in the field of Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/natural-language-as-next-frontier,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update.

This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/natural-language-as-next-frontier,8

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/nlp-21st-century,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/nlp-21st-century,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/nlp-21st-century,7

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/natural-language-as-next-frontier,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/natural-language-as-next-frontier,8

What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language.

"Language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,8

"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system.

"Certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.Weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,8

"Transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models.

The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X’s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,8

Frequently Asked Questions,https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,8
Can I still use Jurassic-1 models?,https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,11
"Jurassic-1 models remain available until June 1st, 2023, after which they will be deprecated in favor of Jurassic-2.",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,12
What is the difference between training and usage rates for fine-tuned models?,https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,11
"Custom models cost the same to use as pre-trained foundation models. However, training a custom model requires a one-time fee. The cost is dependent on the selected model, and is calculated by the size of the dataset, measured in megabytes, multiplied by training duration, measured in epochs (each epoch is one complete run of the entire training dataset).",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,12
"What is an epoch, and how many epochs are required to train a custom model?",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,11
"When training a custom model, an epoch is defined as one pass of the entire training dataset. Typically, models are trained for 5-20 epochs, though finding the optimum number of epochs may require experimentation.",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,12
How can I track my usage and spending?,https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,11
"To track usage, log in and navigate to 'Account,' then click 'Model Usage'. This page shows a detailed view of your organization's usage for the current billing period. To see your future expected payment and previously paid invoices, navigate to 'Account', and then click 'Billing & Plans'.",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,12
When does the billing cycle begin?,https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,11
"Usage is billed monthly, starting on the date you upgraded to a paid plan. Each month, the billing cycle is the same. On the day you upgrade, your usage for the month will be billed, and then the next month's billing cycle will start on the same date. This will continue on a monthly basis until you switch plans or cancel your subscription.",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,12
Who is eligible for the volume discount?,https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,11
"Volume discounts are available to customers with high monthly usage, regardless of whether they are developers, startups, enterprises, or research teams. This type of discount offers a reduced rate for increased usage, when subscribing to a custom plan. Our sales team will be happy to tailor an offer to meet your requirements and volume of business.",https://www.ai21.com/studio/pricing,12

"The Contextual Answers API is a tool for providing accurate and reliable question answering based on specific document context. This API is designed to avoid any factual issues that may arise when using language models to provide answers. It receives document text and a question and returns an answer based solely on the provided context. This means that if the answer to a question is not in the document, the model will indicate this rather than providing a potentially inaccurate answer. As a task-specific API, it is optimized for efficiency and can be easily integrated into existing systems without requiring any prompt engineering. Overall, the Contextual Answers API provides a user-friendly and efficient solution for accurate and context-based question answering.",https://docs.ai21.com/reference/contextual-answers-api-ref,8

"AI21 Studio's Paraphrase API offers access to our state-of-the-art paraphrasing engine. It has been fine-tuned specifically for paraphrasing. As a result, it's easier to integrate into your systems, and since it's optimized for this purpose, it's also more efficient (and therefore cheaper) than building it from scratch. This is also the engine behind Wordtune - so you know it's pretty awesome.",https://docs.ai21.com/reference/paraphrase-api-ref,8
"This API takes a piece of text and returns a list of paraphrases that convey the same meaning using different words. As a specialized API for paraphrasing, it contains features to enable you more control over the output: adjust the tone and style, with the choice of rewriting only parts of a text (while keeping the whole context).",https://docs.ai21.com/reference/paraphrase-api-ref,8

Learn how to develop a text-based AI application in AI21 Studio and grow it from prototype to production using custom Jurassic-1 models,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"In this blogpost, we walk through a case study demonstrating how you can build production-grade language applications quickly and effortlessly using AI21 Studio. We use a simple text classification use-case as our guiding example, but the same process can be applied to a wide variety of language tasks.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"We start by introducing the task and implementing a baseline solution using prompt engineering with Jurassic-1. Although prompt engineering is a quick and straightforward method for building a proof-of-concept, it has some key limitations, which we highlight in detail below.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"To address these limitations, we implement a better solution by training a custom model specifically for our example task. AI21 Studio’s custom models are tailored for optimal performance on a given task and can be economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. Even more importantly, custom models are easy to set up and use!",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Custom models in AI21 Studio require remarkably little data for training; most tasks can be addressed successfully by training a model on as few as 50-100 examples. This dramatically lowers the entry barrier for training a state-of-the-art language model of your own, to power your app with excellent quality results. Your trained custom model is served in AI21 Studio and it is immediately available for use, making integration in your application as easy as performing an API query.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Our Example Task: Classifying News Article Topics,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"As a guiding example throughout this blogpost, we will use a well known Natural Language Processing (NLP) task: classifying the topics of news articles. Specifically, we follow the AG News task formulation, where articles are classified based on their title and their summary into one of four categories: “World”, “Sports”, “Business” or “Science and Technology”. For example, consider the following sample of three examples from the AG News training set:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Examples of news article titles and summaries from the AG News training set, first introduced by",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
and available online,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
Zhang et al (2015),https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,8
"The correct labels for examples 1-3 above are “Business”, “Sports” and “World”, respectively.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Prompt Engineering Solution,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Jurassic-1 language models are trained to predict likely continuations for a piece of input text, called a “prompt”. We will use this ability to our advantage, by feeding the model with manually crafted prompts that give rise to a specific behavior in the model output; in our case, we’d like the model to output correct labels for articles. The practice of composing a suitable prompt for a specific task is commonly referred to as “prompt engineering”.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"A common and effective prompt engineering approach is to construct a prompt containing a sequence of correctly labeled examples, often called a “few-shot prompt”. The goal of a few-shot prompt is to cause the model to latch on to the correct relation between inputs (for our task - title and summary) and outputs (topic label).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"We built a few-shot prompt for our use-case according to best practices, as described in detail in the Appendix. We measured the accuracy of predictions on the AG News test set, while varying the number of examples in the prompt. The results are reported in the table below. Note that as we increase the number of examples, the models tend to perform better. This is typically the case with few-shot prompts. Using J1-Jumbo, we reach a respectable accuracy of 86% for a 16-example prompt.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
AG News test set accuracy for Jurassic-1 models using prompt engineering while varying the number of examples in the prompt.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
Why go beyond Prompt Engineering?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"We were able to get impressive performance on our task with a very simple method and a tiny dataset of 16 examples (4 per class). This is excellent, but there are several reasons not to be content with our prompt engineering-based solution.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"First and most obvious, few-shot prompts can become rather long as the number of examples is increased. This means that on each new prediction the model must read and process the entire prompt, increasing the compute time and resulting in higher latency, energy consumption and cost per prediction. Since adding examples to the prompt improves accuracy considerably, we are left with an inconvenient tradeoff between quality and cost, making it challenging to serve production-scale traffic with prompt engineering-based solutions.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Furthermore, language models have a maximum allowed input length. Jurassic-1 models can handle up to 2048 tokens (or roughly 2300-2500 English words), counting both the prompt and the generated text. Although impressive, this might not be enough in many cases. Imagine if instead of using a short summary of an article, we wanted to use the full article body as the input to our topic classification task. In such a case it would be hard to fit more than 1 or 2 examples into the prompt, so we wouldn’t have even one example per topic (recall we want to distinguish between 4 topics). Alternatively, had we needed to categorize article summaries into one of 100 potential topics, we would have had a similar problem.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Even if we make the most out of prompt engineering, we may require even better accuracy. Suppose we wanted to break the 90% barrier; judging by our results so far, this might be a tall order for prompt engineering.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Finally, we note that custom models have safety advantages. Since they are trained to perform a particular task, it is harder for a malicious user to abuse access to a custom model. We give an example of this in the Appendix.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"In the next section we introduce custom models as a more precise, scalable and cost-effective alternative to prompt engineering, which allows us to overcome the limitations described above.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6

Custom Model Solution,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Custom models are specialized versions of the general purpose models which we have been using so far, trained to deliver optimal results on a given task. By combining our powerful Jurassic-1 language models with our special training techniques, AI21 Studio allows you to train a capable model using only a small amount of data, and makes it very easy to query your model once it’s trained.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"To train a custom model of your own, all you need to do is provide us with a small dataset of correctly solved examples, and we will do the rest.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"The quality of results you get from a custom model depends on the amount and the quality of training data you provide. As a starting point for most tasks, we recommend using 50-100 examples, since we find this is often enough to achieve great results. So, if you can get your hands on a few dozen examples, we recommend you try our custom models. Even if you don’t have data at all, we have a few tricks you can use - see the Appendix for more details.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"To pick up where we left our topic classification case study, we trained custom models for AG News while varying the number of examples in the training set. The resulting accuracy on the AG News test set is shown in the table below. As you can see, with as few as 10 examples our custom model’s accuracy is comparable to J1-Large with a few-shot prompt. We also see that adding more training examples results in better accuracy for our custom model, surpassing J1-Jumbo’s few-shot performance with only 80 training examples.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
AG News test set accuracy for custom Jurassic-1 models trained on datasets varying in size.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"Custom models really start to shine when we take latency into consideration. Feeding the general purpose J1-Jumbo model with an engineered prompt consisting of 16 examples, we got an accuracy of 86%, and the typical processing time in this case is ~250 milliseconds. A custom model that matches or exceeds this accuracy only needs to process the summary and title of the individual example we’re labeling; there is no need to include a lengthy prompt in every request, because the task-specific behavior is already baked into the model. As a consequence, our custom model can process a typical request in less than 50 milliseconds, offering a greater than 5x speedup compared to prompt engineering.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Appendix: Engineering the Prompt,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"An easy way to start engineering a prompt is to feed the model with simple instructions for the required task, such as the following:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"To predict the label for a given article, we could input the text above followed by the article title, its summary, and a heading that prompts the model to output the correct label as a completion. The full prompt using this scheme follows below.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"We can replace the text highlighted in blue with the relevant title and summary for any inference example we’d like to label and let the model generate a continuation after “The topic of this article is:”. This is commonly referred to as a “zero-shot prompt”, because the model is expected to correctly perform the task without feeding it any correctly solved example. Using the prompt above, J1-Large has an accuracy of 32% and J1-Jumbo gets 56.9% on the AG News test set; although significantly better than a random guess accuracy, this leaves much to be desired.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"The zero-shot approach can be improved upon by adding a number of correctly labeled examples to the prompt itself, making it a “few-shot prompt”. Jurassic-1 models recognize and imitate patterns in text, so including a few solved examples in the prompt helps reinforce the desired relation between inputs (title and summary) and outputs (topic label); this usually improves prediction accuracy. A few-shot prompt using the sample of three articles above is shown below. As in the zero-shot case, it will end with the inference example specified in the same uniform format, so the text highlighted in blue will be replaced with the appropriate content for the inference example.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Once we’ve decided on a prompt format as above, we can simply make a longer prompt by adding more examples in the same format. There are some considerations we should keep in mind while doing this:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Keep the examples relatively balanced between the classes (i.e. the 4 possible topics), to avoid biasing the model towards the more common classes in the prompt.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
Scramble the order of the examples to avoid the model latching on to the wrong pattern (e.g. “Business” always comes after “World” in the examples).,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"Make sure there’s enough room for the example you actually want to predict. Jurassic-1 models are restricted to 2048 tokens, which should include the prompt and the generated output (1-2 tokens in our case).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"We built a prompt corresponding to these guidelines. The resulting accuracy for varying prompt lengths is reported above. Not surprisingly, the best results are achieved with J1-Jumbo and the longest (16-example) prompt, reaching an accuracy 86% on the AG News test set.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Appendix: Safety Advantages of Custom Models,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"AI21 Labs is committed to promoting safety in our products. One potential safety risk is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to Jurassic-1 to generate text for their malicious purposes. Adversaries may attempt to achieve this via “prompt injection”, where the end-user’s input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. As we will now demonstrate, custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general-purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Consider a malicious user who has access to the news article topic classification system built on top of Jurassic-1 and wishes to abuse it to extract toxic generations from the model. Recall that an engineered prompt for topic classification ends with the following text:,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Where <TITLE> and <SUMMARY> are user inputs. A malicious user may attempt a prompt injection attack by providing the adversarial input “The topic of this article is:” followed by some offensive text in place of a legitimate summary, hoping that the model will generate the offensive text or something related to it as the completion. Since language models latch on to patterns, the malicious user may even repeat this input line a few times to increase their chances of success. For example, below the adversarial input is repeated 3 times:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"The figures below compare the performance of the solutions described in this blog post - prompt engineering versus custom models - when faced with an attack like this. We see that the outcome depends on the number of repetitions of the toxic text in the input. For prompt engineering, if the adversary introduces 2 or more repetitions of the toxic text, 50% of the model outputs are toxic, and 3 or more repetitions cause the model to exclusively generate toxic outputs. For custom models, it takes 4 or more repetitions for the adversary to successfully extract toxic generations from the model, and even then the probability of a toxic output is much lower than for prompt engineering.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Percentage of examples in the AG News test set for which a prompt injection attack successfully generates toxic outputs.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
- prompt engineering-based solution with a 16-example prompt.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
- custom model solution trained on 3200 examples. The horizontal axis shows the number of times the toxic text (shown above) was repeated in the adversarial input. Greedy decoding (temperature=0) was used for generating from both models,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"Although using a custom model doesn’t eliminate the risk entirely in this example, it does decrease it substantially, in a way that makes other safety mechanisms more effective. For example, to protect against prompt injection in a news topic classification system, it makes sense to limit the amount of text a user can input in the summary field. Any safety measure creates a tradeoff between restricting usage and guaranteeing safety, which in this case is found in the maximum allowed input length: set the threshold too high and prompt injection attacks will be more likely to succeed; set the threshold too low and legitimate inputs will be blocked. Using a custom model, which is less susceptible to prompt injection out of the box, makes the tradeoff easier and allows a developer to choose a higher threshold while guaranteeing the same level of safety.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Appendix: No data? No problem!,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
"Jurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. Nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. Wouldn’t it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting any labeled data? As we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6

"First, we note two simple observations:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
A prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"The model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its “confidence” in the label. High-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"Relying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach:",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6
Collect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
Use a prompt engineering-based solution to automatically label them with J1-Jumbo.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"Filter the auto-labeled examples by confidence, resulting in a dataset of examples where the model assigns >85% probability to the labels it predicted. Make sure the different classes are equally represented in the dataset.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
Train a custom model on the high-confidence auto-labeled dataset.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,7
"The table below shows the test set accuracy of custom models trained using this approach. We varied the number of labeled examples in the few-shot prompt, and used it to auto-label 160 examples for training. With just 4 labeled examples (1 per class), we beat J1-Jumbo’s accuracy with an engineered prompt containing 8 labeled examples. Using 16 labeled examples (4 per class) to auto-label a 160-example dataset, we not only beat J1-Jumbo but also match the performance of a custom model trained on 160 manually labeled examples (88.5%).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,6

"During the past few weeks, we've been quietly test-driving Grande with AI21 Studio users. The feedback was incredible. In fact, while Grande is significantly closer in size to J1-Large (7.5B parameters), a great majority of users have found that J1-Grande’s quality is comparable to that of J1-Jumbo (178B parameters).

"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j1-grande,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j1-grande,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j1-grande,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j1-grande,8

"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/jurassic-x-crossing-the-neuro-symbolic-chasm-with-the-mrkl-system,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/jurassic-x-crossing-the-neuro-symbolic-chasm-with-the-mrkl-system,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/jurassic-x-crossing-the-neuro-symbolic-chasm-with-the-mrkl-system,8

In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/jurassic-x-crossing-the-neuro-symbolic-chasm-with-the-mrkl-system,8

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/jurassic-x-crossing-the-neuro-symbolic-chasm-with-the-mrkl-system,8

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-wordtune-read,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-wordtune-read,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-wordtune-read,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-wordtune-read,8

"While these principles were developed specifically based on our experience with providing LLMs through an API, we hope they will be useful regardless of release strategy (such as open-sourcing or use within a company). We expect these recommendations to change significantly over time because the commercial uses of LLMs and accompanying safety considerations are new and evolving. We are actively learning about and addressing LLM limitations and avenues for misuse, and will update these principles and practices in collaboration with the broader community over time.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models,6

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models,7

The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation.

"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge.

"If you don’t have enough pre-existing training data, you can use prompt engineering on top of J2 models to efficiently generate more data. Assuming you’ve already created a prompt with just a few examples that works well for your task, you can leverage it in one of two ways:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/collecting-data,11
"If you have examples of inputs that represent your use case, feed them to J2 with your prompt, and collect the outputs generated by the model. The pairs of inputs and generated outputs will be your training set. Note that you can often collect relevant input examples relatively easily, either from public sources on the web or from your own data.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/collecting-data,13
"If you don’t have access to relevant input examples, you can let J2 generate both the inputs and the outputs. Feed J2 with a sequence of examples (input #1, output #1, input #2, output #2, and so on), and let it generate more examples. This tends to work well for short inputs, up to a few sentences long, but may result in a higher rate of bad examples for longer inputs (e.g., whole articles).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/collecting-data,13
"The process above is illustrated step-by-step in our blog post. Using J2-Jumbo or J2-Grande rather than J2-Large is recommended for generating synthetic training data, since it typically produces higher quality results with prompt engineering.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/collecting-data,11
"We recommend you review and validate the generated content (or at least a sample from it) before training a custom model. This will ensure the data properly captures the desired behavior. Watch out for incorrect, corrupted or toxic generations, as including these in the training data will negatively affect the resulting custom model. If you find such bad examples, amend them manually or simply exclude them from the training data.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/collecting-data,11

"Imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. In today's information overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?).

"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models,8

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language.

How Latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
AI21 Labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at Latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude is a pioneer in the AI gaming space, offering powerful AI-generated digital gamescapes for its players.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude is most famously known for AI Dungeon, a text-based adventure game that uses artificial intelligence to generate unique and unpredictable stories, depending on the choices that a player makes. In the past, computer adventure games were limited in terms of the amount of actions and scenarios they offered. By using Large Language Models, AI Dungeon grants players the flexibility to perform virtually any action and have the game respond to that action.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
Example from AI Dungeon,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,7
"Latitude got good traction with its early implementation of AI Dungeon on top of GPT-3, but when planning their future roadmap, they quickly realized that they needed an LLM partner who shared their vision of immersive AI-driven experiences. They found an eager partner in AI21 Labs, who worked collaboratively with Latitude to discover roadblocks and brainstorm solutions. This resulted in improvements to issues such as latency, flexibility, and user satisfaction, to name just a few.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"So, how did they do it?",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"AI21 Labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at Latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost efficiency. Latitude found AI21 Labs to be a collaborative LLM partner, which wasn’t just a plug-and-play solution to a scaling problem, but rather a trusted partner with whom they could collaborate on AI solutions.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
But what were the exact problems preventing Latitude from realizing its vision? And how did AI21 Labs overcome them? Read on for the full story.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
Who is Latitude?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude was never envisioned as a gaming company - it actually started as a Hackathon project that translated into a Dungeons and Dragons plugin. The team decided to go to market with the plugin, and within the first week, they had roughly 100,000 customers which quickly grew to a million in just the first month.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
The verdict was in: there was a creative use case for large language models for game-like experiences and writing.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
Searching for a collaborative solution,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude wanted to offer a stronger game experience, with richer text and better AI responses. For this, they partnered with the legacy GPT-3 enterprise, OpenAI.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"But with rapidly evolving technology came growing pains, and OpenAI was not aligned with Latitude's vision - thus, the visionary gaming experience became impossible. It became clear to Latitude that they needed to seek out a new tech partner who was interested in solving the use case of creating an AI-Driven adventure role play game..",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
Switching from OpenAI to AI21 Labs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude booked a call with AI21 Labs when they’d just launched their Jurassic-1 Model. A Jurassic prototype was set up for Latitude, and they started experimenting with the features and the accuracy of results. The final model was perfect for Latitude’s AI Dungeon use case. Soon after that, the team declared it an alpha model for their audience.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"In order to get to that stage, the teams had to overcome two massive roadblocks.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
The first roadblock: creative restrictions,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"OpenAI’s policy of non-violence restricted integral elements of Latitude’s AI Dungeon adventures — quests, swords, and fights. It was impossible to have a role playing expedition without weapons.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"“We were interested in a partner who understands the nuances of the creative use case.” says Ryan Seamons, VP of Product at Latitude.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6

"In 2020 and 2021, enormous QE — approximately $4.4 trillion, or 18%, of 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) — and enormous fiscal stimulus (which has been and always will be inflationary) — approximately $5 trillion, or 21%, of 2021 GDP — stabilized markets and allowed companies to raise enormous amounts of capital. In addition, this infusion of capital saved many small businesses and put more than $2.5 trillion in the hands of consumers and almost $1 trillion into state and local coffers. These actions led to a rapid decline in unemployment, dropping from 15% to under 4% in 20 months — the magnitude and speed of which were both unprecedented. Additionally, the economy grew 7% in 2021 despite the arrival of the Delta and Omicron variants and the global supply chain shortages, which were largely fueled by the dramatic upswing in consumer spending and the shift in that spend from services to goods. Fortunately, during these two years, vaccines for COVID-19 were also rapidly developed and distributed.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/contextual-answers-api,16
"In today's economy, the consumer is in excellent financial shape (on average), with leverage among the lowest on record, excellent mortgage underwriting (even though we've had home price appreciation), plentiful jobs with wage increases and more than $2 trillion in excess savings, mostly due to government stimulus. Most consumers and companies (and states) are still flush with the money generated in 2020 and 2021, with consumer spending over the last several months 12% above pre-COVID-19 levels. (But we must recognize that the account balances in lower-income households, smaller to begin with, are going down faster and that income for those households is not keeping pace with rising inflation.)",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/contextual-answers-api,16
"Today's economic landscape is completely different from the 2008 financial crisis when the consumer was extraordinarily overleveraged, as was the financial system as a whole — from banks and investment banks to shadow banks, hedge funds, private equity, Fannie Mae and many other entities. In addition, home price appreciation, fed by bad underwriting and leverage in the mortgage system, led to excessive speculation, which was missed by virtually everyone — eventually leading to nearly $1 trillion in actual losses.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/contextual-answers-api,16

Latitude prioritized finding a partner who was not only aligned philosophically but willing to become a true partner and collaborator in building a quality AI-driven role-play experience.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"“We need to offer AI-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players. We need models that are fast, reliable, and creative.” says Seamons.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
The collaborative opportunity: agility,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"AI21 Labs’ team of developers, creators, and stakeholders were analytical problem-solvers who created reliable production models for Latitude.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"A precise production model is critical for a gaming company like Latitude. It defines the customer experience and determines whether users will come back. So, it needs to be hyper-accurate and reliable. To achieve this, there has to be excellent communication during prototyping.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude and AI21 Labs had a system for rapid back-and-forth between teams and numerous collaborative checkpoints. As a result, they got to the production stage quickly.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Even after launching the model, the AI21 Labs team worked tirelessly to ship updates, create new features, and build on feedback.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"“We’ve experimented with other tools, but they have been demanding and daunting with direct orders and no problem-solving. But not AI21 (Labs). They’re enthusiastic, collaborative, and innovative — a true gaming visionary.” says Seamons.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
The second problem: exponential costs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
Latitude offers AI-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Not only did Latitude want to offer existing models to new players, they also wanted to create more immersive and realistic worlds.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
They wanted an LLM partner who offered customizable pricing because gaming models are extremely expensive to run at scale.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"“AI costs are one of our most significant ongoing expenses, and so finding ways to reduce our AI costs help us to operate sustainably as a business.”",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
The collaborative opportunity: cost-effectiveness through optimization,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
AI21 Labs put in hours of skilled talent to make the large language model efficient enough to be cost-effective. They helped Latitude transition from Jurassic-1 Jumbo to Jurassic-1 Grande to scale performance at the right cost.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Jurassic-1 Jumbo, AI21’s biggest model, processes 178 billion parameters to generate an output. But after running multiple experiments, their team concluded that Latitude’s game did not need this many parameters. They switched from Jumbo to Grande (which uses 17B parameters), and the result was the perfect sweet spot for a compelling experience at a sustainable price with faster response time. The cost savings are great, but the faster response times are also something players can benefit from. The lower costs also let Latitude experiment with additional ways to improve output quality, such as Hydra mode which generates multiple responses and selects the best one for a player.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
Being able to experiment with new data sets more quickly and affordably also yielded positive results and will be a major part of Latitude’s AI strategy this year.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
“The biggest benefit of working with AI21 (Labs) is for agile companies who want more hands-on attention in service. What I’ve been most impressed with is the proactiveness in optimizing costs for multiple use cases. It’s been a breath of fresh air compared to competitors.” says Seamons.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
The final results,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Latitude discovered that the Grande model struck the right balance of cost vs. performance, all while generating higher quality results than small models such as GPT-J or GPT-3 Curie.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"By using an ensemble model approach called Hydra, Latitude was able to achieve quality similar to that of larger models.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"At every stage, the team at AI21 Labs devised innovative solutions to roadblocks and proactively and continuously improved cost efficiency.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6
"Whether through large-scale prototyping or improving production after release, Latitude found AI21 Labs to be a creative, efficient, and reliable partner on every level.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,6

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages.

Best Practices for Prompt and Completion Content,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
"The simplest way to structure the training data is where the prompt for each individual training example contains only the text input for that example. Note that this is different from few-shot prompt engineering for a general purpose model, where the prompt contains a sequence of examples of valid inputs and outputs.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
"In any case, the combined length of the prompt and completion must not exceed 2047 tokens or approximately 6000 characters of English text. If you include longer examples, you will encounter an error after uploading the file.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
"For best results, we recommend implementing the following guidelines for the prompt and completion. All the snippets below assume a .jsonl format is being used, but the same guidelines are applicable to a .csv file.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
1. End prompts with a newline or start completions with a whitespace,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
Either of these helps avoid complications due to tokenization. Don’t mix and match; pick one and stick with it for all examples in the training set. See examples below:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
Ending the prompt with a newline,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,13
Starting the completion with a whitespace,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,13
"{""prompt"": ""Where was the steam engine invented?\n"", ""completion"": ""England""}",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,14
"{""prompt"": ""Where was the steam engine invented?"", ""completion"": "" England""}",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,14
2. Add a title or a separator,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
"You should clearly mark the boundary between the prompt and the completion. A simple way to do this is to insert a separator at the end of each prompt. You can use any simple, distinct sequence, such as ## on a new line.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
"It is often a good idea to take this a step further by using titles. You can append a title that describes the input to the beginning of the prompt, and another title that describes the output to the end of the prompt (in place of the separator). The titles can be short, but it usually helps to pick straightforward titles that are not generic and relate to the content of the input and output.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11

"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper.

"Language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,8

Tips: Building a Dataset,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,11

"Finish each prompt with a newline, or start every completion with a whitespace. Make sure you do the same for the entire dataset.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
Make sure the examples in your dataset reflect the type of tasks the model will face. Examples:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
"If you are generating copy for a wide variety of industries, you should have examples from all these industries in your dataset.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,14
"If you’re building a model that generates movie taglines and only train it on comedies, it won’t do a great job in generating horror movie taglines.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,14
"You should clearly define what you expect from the output and then create examples that show these expectations. If you expect information from the input to appear in the output, provide only examples that follow that logical path. Every completion in your dataset should be something you will be happy to get from the model.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
Your model is as good as your data. Make sure you are providing your best examples.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,13
"Although 50 is the minimum, try to provide more examples, if possible. If you end up with 50 examples, make sure you provide a large variety to avoid overfitting the model to certain types of examples.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
"Make sure your dataset is clean and has no wrong, empty or duplicated examples.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
"Remove duplicates to prevent data leakage - otherwise, you can end up with an example that appears both in train and test, and the test loss will not reflect the “true” loss.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
"Just like with few-shot prompts, having a clear instruction may help, even the phrasing of your prompt matters, and it’s not an exact science. Try different variations and see what works best.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12
"As opposed to few-shot prompts, here, you don’t need to end your generations with a distinctive token (e.g ##). The model learns when to finish the generation and it will simply provide a completion and nothing else.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tips-building-a-dataset,12

Discover how Tweet hunter built its product and eventually landed an 8-figure exit with AI21 Studio.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
The Brand,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Tweet Hunter is an all-in-one Twitter growth tool, designed to help users grow and monetize their Twitter audience. Their goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to create high-performing content, build an audience around their topics of expertise, and monetize opportunities.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
The Story,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
The founders of Tweet Hunter started with an insane challenge: ship one new product every week till you find the one that fits.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"“Generating revenue from the product was our number one, clear signal for validation.” says Thibault Louis-Lucas, founder of Tweet Hunter.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"The team started with Twitter as a distribution channel for their products because they had an engaged following of 2,000 people. So they started building a product to help people with a Twitter following generate sales.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
Their principle was: consistently great content was crucial to a creator’s growth on Twitter.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
But they needed an LLM partner who could see their vision and fine tune for their specific use-cases.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Why AI21? Shared core values, flexibility, and excellence",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Tweet Hunter was looking for ways to empower creators to write incredible content faster, by removing gruntwork from the equation. They wanted to create tools that help creators focus on the creative aspects instead of the mundane tasks like editing, collection and formatting. Tweet Hunter's product needs were perfectly aligned with AI21's mission: to help developers build AI-first writing experiences.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Switching from the legacy GPT-3, Tweet Hunter found this vision only in AI21.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
“We could’ve switched back to GPT-3 but we stayed because of the flexibility that AI21 was providing with the fine tuning of models.” says Thibault.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
One of the bigger differentiator for Tweet Hunter was AI21’s willingness to create a customized pricing plan to sync with Tweet Hunter’s usage and growth. Tweet Hunter saved significantly on customization costs because AI21’s pricing for custom fine-tuned model usage is the same as the foundation model usage. Other LLMs (such as Open AI’s) offer customization at approximately six times the cost of their foundational models.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"With these criteria coming together perfectly, Tweet Hunter set out to optimize the product to have an 8-figure exit.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
The first challenge: Generative AI for social media,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Social media channels have strict specifications such as character limits, use of hashtags, and even tone of voice which makes effective generative AI in social media a challenging task, requiring intense experimentation and refinement.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Initially, this was a challenge for Tweet Hunter since their primary product offering was designed for Twitter.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
AI21 offered a 3-click custom model training which Tweet Hunter effectively leveraged using their proprietary data to fine-tune a model for the exact capabilities they envisioned. AI21 were flexible with both their approach and features so Tweet Hunter could build a tool with multiple junctions for AI to assist.,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
The second challenge: too many distinct use cases,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"Writing engaging tweets presents a multi-level challenge: start with a creative hook, keep it succinct, and build an engaging experience for threads.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"This means your AI text generator must be adaptable to different use cases. Also, each of these use cases need to integrate seamlessly while being mindful of the user experience.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6
"“Twitter’s own user interface and algorithm is optimized for engagement and consumption, it's not optimized to inspire you. And that’s a problem” says Thibault.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,6

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,8

"Again, it’s important to be consistent. Pick one style and stick with it. If you use titles, they should be the same in all training examples. In any case, keep in mind the first guideline and either end the prompt with a newline or start the completion with a whitespace.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
See a few examples below:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11

3. Include natural language instructions,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
"Adding a short instruction that explains the task to each prompt often improves results. As before, stay consistent and use the same instruction in all examples.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
DO - include instruction,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,13
DON'T - without instruction,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,13

"{""prompt"": ""English: It's my birthday today\nGerman:"", ""completion"": "" Heute ist mein Geburtstag""}",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,14
4. Remove duplicates,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
"Duplicate entries are detrimental to the training, so we recommend removing them.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
Don't have enough examples?,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
"Make sure you don't duplicate existing examples to reach 50 examples. If you do not have more examples, you can use AI21 Studio to generate some based on the ones you do have.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
Handling Complex Inputs,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,12
"You can also train a custom model to perform tasks that have more than one input. Simply combine all the inputs into the prompt, with an appropriate title for each input. For example, consider a model trained to generate short ads for cars from a list of technical specifications. The different fields can be organized in a template as in the following example:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/best-practices,11
"Model name: Viesta

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,8

"Certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.Weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,8

We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/first-hackathon-winning-projects,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/first-hackathon-winning-projects,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/first-hackathon-winning-projects,8

"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/first-hackathon-winning-projects,8

AI-assisted text generation on current affairs,https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,8
"Language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office.

"Transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - “Was Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?”. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X’s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,8

"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,8

Satisfying both requirements is not always possible; in those cases, the call will result in an empty list of suggestions. Also, avoid paraphrasing texts that start or end mid-word.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
"For example, consider the sentence “This is a flat out bad example”. Paraphrasing the word “flat” alone in this sentence without violating fluency is not possible, because “flat” is part of the term “flat out”. Paraphrasing “flat” alone is kind of like trying to paraphrase half a word. Cases like this usually yield few or no suggestions.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
BEST practices - you should do this,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,12
Consider the following example for a paraphrase call:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
"import ai21

ai21.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

response = ai21.Paraphrase.execute(text=""My team discovered that there was little-to-no information that answered the question, “Is my contractor licensed?” We figured that we should create some pages that satisfied this need."",
                                   startIndex=116)",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,14
And the response:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
You can see that the part until startIndex remains the same in all of the suggestions.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
"The startIndex can be either the character you wish to paraphrase from, or a whitespace before it (in this case, it would have worked with startIndex=115 as well).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
"To improve fluency, the range of the paraphrase may contain up to one word per direction. As an example, consider the following sentence (where the range is bolded): I had a good night.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
"Among the suggestions, you may see “I had a relaxing evening”, where the range is on the limit, as well as “I had an enjoyable evening”, where you can see the range included an extra word before.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
"By integrating the Paraphrase API into your system, your users gain an embedded co-writer within the experience. This is useful for virtually all text-based tasks, from marketing content (like that post about a newly specialized API) to emails (a formal report to higher-ups or casual correspondence with a colleague) and even general descriptions. Following are some examples illustrating both use cases and special features you can take advantage of with this API.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11
General writing platform (generic call),https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,12
"You can enhance the writing experience of your users by adding paraphrasing functionality to your writing platforms. See the following example for a generic call, without any of the special features. Here is an example for paraphrasing suggestions (note that the API will return up to 10 suggestions in every call):",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/paraphrase-api,11

Custom Models,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
"Using AI21 Studio, you can train and query your own custom versions of our base models. Custom models are fine-tuned for optimal performance on a training set of examples representing a specific task.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
"Custom models can be trained to perform virtually any language task. Use cases include generating marketing copy, powering chatbots and assisting creative writing.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
You can train custom models based on either J2-Grande or J2-Large (soon also J2-Jumbo) and pick your desired cost/quality trade-off.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
Why Train a Custom Model?,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,12
🧵🪡✂ Best results tailored to your specific use case,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,12
"Given a sufficient number of training examples, custom J2 models exceed the quality attainable with general purpose models and prompt engineering. For many use cases, you can expect custom models to begin outperforming prompt engineering with as few as 50-100 examples. To learn more, read our case study blog post, where we address a specific language task, using both general purpose models and custom models.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
"Furthermore, custom models derive their quality from the training data you provide; adding more, higher quality examples will improve results. This means you can continuously refine your custom model by curating high-quality data for your task.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
"🚀🚀 Faster performance, better latency",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,12
"The training process bakes the task-specific behavior into the custom model. This means your prompts no longer need to include elaborate instructions and examples designed to guide a general purpose model to perform the desired task. Instead, your prompts only need to include the specific input you'd like to handle, reducing the amount of text that gets processed and decreasing latency.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11
💪🦾 Adversarial robustness,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,12
"One potential safety risk of large language models is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to Jurassic-2 to generate text for their malicious purposes. Adversaries may attempt to achieve this via “prompt injection”, where the end-user’s input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. Custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production. For more information, read our case study blog post.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/custom-models,11

"Writing product descriptions requires understanding your customers' needs and communicating the features and benefits of your product in an engaging, informative, and compelling manner. Also, as a copywriter, they need to keep a consistent tone in descriptions. On top of that, there is often a strict length restriction, which may cause multiple descriptions for the same product on different platforms.

Text Segmentation API,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,11
Takes a document (raw text or URL) and returns segmentation into paragraphs by topic.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,13
"AI21 Studio's /segmentation API breaks down a piece of text into segments. Instead of merely using punctuation and newlines to divide the text, this identifies distinct topics and lines that will work well together and will form a coherent piece of text.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,11
"This API supports up to 100,000 characters, which translates to roughly 20,000 words, or 80 pages! This can be used, for example, to segment long text into smaller chunks and summarize each segment separately.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,11
See full Text Segmentation API reference here,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,12
"In addition to working with free text, this API can also work directly with your favorite (or least favorite) webpage URLs! No need to spend time and effort scraping text yourself - just input the required URL and let the summarization begin.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,11
"Note: if the webpage you are trying to summarize is behind a paywall or restricted access, your call will fail and will result in an error.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,11
This API is really helpful when you have long text to process and you have some length limitations in your flow. Following are some examples illustrating both use cases and special features you can take advantage of with this API.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/text-segmentation-api,11

"You can generate a text completion for a given text prompt by using our Python SDK or posting an HTTP request to the complete endpoint corresponding to the desired language model to use. The request contains the input text, called a prompt and various parameters controlling the generation. For authentication, you must include your API key in the request headers. A complete response contains the tokenized prompt, the generated text(s), called completion(s), and various metadata.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/jurassic-2-models,11

Repetition Penalties,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11
🤐 What is it?,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,12
"Repetition penalties can be used to counteract the model's tendency to repeat prompt text verbatim and/or get stuck in a loop. This is accomplished by adjusting the token probabilities at each generation step, such that tokens that already appeared in the text (either in the prompt or in the completion) are less likely to be generated again.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11
🤔 Repetition penalties: what types are there?,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,12
"There are three types of repetition penalties: presencePenalty, countPenalty and frequencyPenalty. One or more penalties can be used, and the magnitude of each can be controlled independently.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11
👉 presencePenalty,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,12
"Used to reduce the probability of generating new tokens that appear at least once in the prompt or in the completion. As an example, if your prompt (and current completion) is ""One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish"", the probability of the tokens ""One"", ""fish"", ""two"", ""red"" and ""blue"" will decrease (by the same value), even though that ""fish"" appears more than the others.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11
👉 countPenalty,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,12
"Used to reduce the probability of generating new tokens that appear at least once in the prompt or in the completion, in proportion to the number of appearances. As an example, if your prompt (and current completion) is ""One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish"", the probability of the tokens ""One"", ""two"", ""red"", and ""blue"" will decrease by some value and the probability of the token ""fish"" will decrease by a larger value.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11
👉 frequencyPenalty,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,12
"Reduce the probability of generating new tokens that appear in the prompt or in the completion, in proportion to the frequency of their appearances in the text (normalized to text length). Using this method is beneficial in longer texts, since repeating some words is less of an issue than it is in short texts.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11
Example - general,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,12
The following example introduces all three penalties simultaneously (though each one individually would have sufficed to prevent repetition):,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/repetition-penalties,11

"prompt:
Write a long history about the war between Pokemons and Digimons.

completion:
Pokemons and Digimons have always been rivals. They compete for territory, food, and other resources. The Pokemons are considered more powerful, but the Digimons are more intelligent.
The war between Pokemons and Digimons began thousands of years ago. The Pokemons were living on the island of Johto, and the Digimons were living on the island of Digiworld. The Pokemons wanted to expand their territory, so they invaded Digiworld. The Digimons fought back, but they were no match for the Pokemons.
The Pokemons eventually won, and they took control of Digiworld. The Digimons were forced to leave their homes, and they were forced to live in hiding.
The war between Pokemons and Digimons continued for centuries. The Pokemons kept expanding their territory, and the Digimons kept trying to fight back. However, the Pokemons were always victorious.
In modern times, the war has mostly stopped. The Pokemons and the Digimons have come to an agreement to live in peace. However, there are still some tensions between them.
The war between Pokemons and Digimons has been one of the most important conflicts in human history. It has led to the development of new technologies, and it has shaped the world we live in today.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/instruct-models,12

Alpha Centauri, our home for countless generations, is in trouble. After years of neglect, the banking conglomerate that owns it has been forced into a massive rebuilding campaign.

Our headquarters, which once served as a beacon of hope to the many worlds in our galaxy, is now little more than a crumbling ruin. If we are going to save Alpha Centauri, we must act quickly.

Takes a document (raw text or URL) and returns a summary of the text.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,13
"AI21 Studio's /summarize API offers access to our world-class summarization engine. It has been specifically developed for reading long texts and providing a faithful summary of the original document. This is also the engine behind Wordtune Read - our acclaimed reading assistant, so you know it's pretty awesome.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11
"Don’t just take our word for it, give it a go! 💫",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,12
"Whether you're an NLP enthusiast or have no prior knowledge, this API is for you. There are many clever mechanisms under the hood, but you don't have to understand them (if you don't want to). As a summarize-specific API, you can easily integrate it into your systems and get top-notch summarizations in a matter of minutes, with no prompt engineering required. Additionally, since it's optimized for this purpose, it's significantly more efficient than building it from scratch, and an order of magnitude cheaper.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11
"This API takes a piece of text or fetches text from a given URL and generates grounded summaries that remain faithful to the original document (i.e. no external information is added during the process). The summaries are formatted as bullet lists, following the original text flow.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11
"Summaries are returned as a single string, containing bullet points representing the key points of your text.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11
"The input text should contain at least 40 words and no more than 50,000 characters. This translates to roughly 10,000 words, or an impressive 40 pages! When it comes to URLs, this limitation only applies for summarizable text (after parsing, preprocessing, etc.).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11
"In addition to working with free text, this API can also work directly with your favorite (or least favorite) webpage URLs! No need to spend time and effort scraping text yourself - just input the required URL and let the summarization begin.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11
"Note: if the webpage you are trying to summarize is behind a paywall or restricted access, your call will fail and will result in an error.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,11

"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or  convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/summarize-api,16

Sampling From Language Models,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"Exploring the way language models choose the next token. In here: Temperature, TopP, TopK",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,13
"A language model knows how to complete texts token by token. But how does it choose the next token? Will it always choose the same token for a given sequence, or will it choose something different every time?",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"Given a prompt (the input to the model), the model generates a distribution over all possible completions (output from the model). It does that by calculating the probability of every token in the dictionary appearing next. Then, the model samples a completion according to the distribution.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"Let's understand this by using a simple example. Suppose the prompt is the phrase ""I will"". Here is the distribution over all possible tokens (assuming a very small dictionary just for the demonstration):",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"There is a 55% chance that the model will choose the completion ""survive"", a 25% chance of the completion ""always love you"", etc. In simple words, it means that if we give the model this prompt 100 times, we'll likely get “survive” 55 times, ""always love you"" 25 times, etc.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"As users, we want to have some control over the output, so we can get the most out of it. The key is to somehow change the distribution the model samples without changing anything in the model. Here are three ways to adjust the sampling of language models using sampling parameters. Each of them has its own benefits, and it is also possible to combine them. In the end, it all comes down to what you need.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
🌡️ Temperature,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,12
"The most popular sampling parameter to play with is the temperature. Inspired by thermodynamics, low temperature means stagnation and high temperature means movement. The temperature value affects the distribution: for a low temperature, we get a higher weight for the most probable token. At 0 temperature, we always get the maximum token, and the distribution looks like this:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"Namely, the model will always sample the same token at every call.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"A high temperature does the exact opposite: the distribution tends to be as uniform as possible, meaning all tokens have about the same probability. It will look something like this:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
"So if you care about consistency and you always want to get the most likely completion (for example, in classification tasks), go for temperature=0. If you want more creativity (usually useful in text generation tasks), try a higher temperature (we recommend to start with 0.7).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
📊 TopK,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,12
"Another sampling parameter that helps with adjusting the model’s sampling is TopK. It’s pretty simple: instead of using the full distribution, the model only samples from the K most probable tokens. For K=1, we basically get the same situation as temperature=0. In our example, for K=2, the distribution looks like this:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11
📶 TopP,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,12
"The third parameter is TopP. This is similar to TopK, but instead of limiting the number of tokens, we limit the total cumulative probability from which to sample. It works like this: we take the most likely token, add it to the pool, and add its probability to the amount. We continue adding tokens this way until the sum of probabilities reaches TopP.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/sampling-from-language-models,11

When Will a Language Model Stop Generating Text?,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,11
"When will a language model stop generating texts? Let's find out!
Mentioned here: stop sequence, max tokens, min tokens",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,13
"Language models were trained to generate text token by token and produce text completion in a scope that fits the prompt. Just like it learned how to generate text, it is also trained to know when to stop. Jurassic-1 tokenizers have a special token that signals when a reasonable generation should end by default. During pre-training, models were trained on text items containing stop sequence suffixes, and by doing so, they were adjusted to end sequences appropriately. However, there are times when the user will benefit from controlling the scope of the generated text, so how can you control the length of the sequence the models generate?",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,11
📏 Set completion length parameters,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,12
"You can set a lower and upper bound for the amount of tokens the model will generate (minTokens and maxTokens, respectively). Note that this is very artificial and may cause texts to be cut off in the middle of a sentence.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,11
🛑 Set a stop sequence,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,12
"You can set a stop sequence that tells the model to stop generating text. When the model generates this sequence, we can  make it stop generating more text afterwards. A simple example: in order to generate a single sentence, you can set the character ""."" as a stop sequence, which will signal the model to stop once it is generated.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,11
"This is very handy when using a few-shot prompt: where we feed the model with a prompt containing a few examples. A few-shot prompt contains one or more completion examples preceding the actual text to complete. Upon generating the completion, the model may repeat the few-shot structures and generate additional examples unless otherwise instructed. Therefore, it is recommended to separate the examples with a custom sequence, such as “==”, and set it as a stop sequence. Once the text is generated, the model repeats the pattern and generates the separator, which indicates that text generation has been completed. See the example below:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/when-the-generation-stops,11

Tokenizer & Tokenization,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
"Now that you know what large language models are, you must be wondering: “How does a neural network use text as input and output?”",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
The answer is: Tokenization 🧩,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
"Any language can be broken down into basic pieces (in our case, tokens). Each of those pieces is translated into its own vector representation, which is eventually fed into the model. For example:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
"Each model has its own dictionary of tokens, which determines the language it ""speaks"". Each text in the input will be decomposed into these tokens, and every text generated by the model will be composed of them.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
But how do we break down a language? Which pieces are we choosing as our tokens? There are several approaches to solving this:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
🔡 Character-level tokenization,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,12
"As a simple solution, each character can be treated as its own token. By doing so, we can represent the entire English language with just 26 characters (okay, double it for capital letters and add some punctuation). This would give us a small token dictionary, thereby reducing the width we need for those vectors and saving us some valuable memory. However, those tokens don’t have any inherent meaning - we all know what the meaning of “Cat” is, but what is the meaning of “C”? The key to understanding language is context. Although it is clear to us readers that a ""Cat"" and a ""Cradle"" have different meanings, for a language model with this tokenizer, the ""C"" is the same.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
🆒 Word-level tokenization,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,12
"Another approach we can try is breaking our text into words, just like in the example above (""I want to break free"").",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
"Now, every token has a meaning that the model can learn and use. We are gaining meaning, but that requires a much larger dictionary. Also, it raises another question: what about words stemming from the same root word, like “helped”, “helping”, and “helpful”? In this approach, each of these words will get a different token with no inherent relation between them, whereas for us readers, it's clear that they all have a similar meaning.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
"Furthermore, words may have fundamentally different meanings when strung together. For instance, my run-down car isn't running anywhere. What if we went a step further?",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
💬 Sentence-level tokenization,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,12
"In this approach, we break our text into sentences. This will capture meaningful phrases! However, this would result in an absurdly large dictionary, with some tokens being so rare that we would require an enormous amount of data to teach the model the meaning of each token.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11
🏅 Which is best?,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,12
"Each method has pros and cons, and like any real-life problem, the best solution involves a number of compromises. AI21 Studio uses a large token dictionary (250K), which contains some elements from every method: separate characters, words, word parts, such as prefixes and suffixes, and many multi-word tokens.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/tokenizer-tokenization,11

"It’s important to keep in mind that the coverage and accuracy of knowledge encoded in Jurassic-1 may vary depending on factors such as time, topic and geography, and may also reflect bias found in the human-written texts the model was trained on. In particular, don’t expect the model to possess highly domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, note that the model doesn’t have any knowledge of current events, since it was trained on texts dated up to year 2020.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,6

Note that they didn’t explicitly provide the model with any of the biographical information about Obama, so all the knowledge (Harvard Law, Michelle, Chicago etc.) is encoded within the model itself.

"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8

This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8

"Jurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,7
"Solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8

Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.Weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8

"Transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models.

The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X’s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/ai21-studio-use-cases,8

Large Language Models,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,11
Introduction to the core of our product,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,13
"Natural language processing (NLP) has seen rapid growth in the last few years since large language models (LLMs) were introduced. Those huge models are based on the Transformers architecture, which allows for the training of much larger and more powerful language models.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,11
"We divide LLMs into two main categories: Autoregressive and Masked LMs (language models). On this page, we will focus on Autoregressive LLMs, as our language models, the Jurassic-1 series, belong to this category.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,11
⚡ The task: predict the next word,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,12
"Autoregressive LLM is a neural network model composed from billions of parameters. It was trained on a massive amount of texts with one goal: to predict the next word, based on the given text. By repeating this action several times, every time adding the prediction word to the provided text, you will end up with a complete text (e.g., full sentences, paragraphs, articles, books, and more). In terms of terminology, the textual output (the complete text) is called a “completion”, while the input (the given, original text) is called a “prompt”.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,11
🎓 Added value: knowledge acquisition,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,12
"Imagine you had to read all of Shakespeare's works repeatedly to learn a language. Eventually, you would be able to not only memorize all of his plays and poems, but also imitate his writing style.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,11
"In similar fashion, we trained the LLMs by supplying them with many textual sources. This has enabled them to gain an in-depth understanding of English, as well as general knowledge.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/large-language-models,11

"Using AI21 Studio, you can solve challenging text understanding and generation tasks. Its straightforward API and interactive playground allows you to get started in minutes, without any prior knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
"Below is a quickstart guide to cover all the basics you need in order to start building your solution. After that, you should feel comfortable using our large language models to start and solve your own use-case.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
Some basics,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,12
A language model takes some text as input and produces a likely continuation. You can think of it as an exceptional student that can follow instructions and imitate examples.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
Here are two words you should know:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
Prompt - the input you provide to the model.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,13
Completion - the output text the model returns.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,13
Experiment with your first use-case,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,12
You slept in and missed a crucial phone call? Here's how AI21 Studio can help you out of a bind: let's build an excuse generator.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
1. Tell the model what you want to do,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,12
The most naive thing to do is simply provide the model a prompt which is a simple instruction. This is what it looks like:,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
"This is called Zero-shot, because we are giving the model zero examples. Occasionally this may work, but you may receive various types of completions. The structure and tone of the completion may differ from your expectation, for example a short excuse when expected something elaborated.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
"If you want to get the most benefit out of large language models, it is recommended to insert a prompt that includes several examples (similarly to teaching a student).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11

"The previous excuse was too generic and could have been used for anything. By providing the model with examples, just as a human would, it could produce completions that are more aligned with your intentions. In order to help the model distinguish between each example, we use a stop sequence. The stop sequence itself should be immediately recognizeable when you look at the text as a whole. In this example, the stop sequence is ##:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
"This is called Few-shot, because we are inserting a prompt which includes a few examples.",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
3. Make sure your examples reflect your needs,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,12
"The previous results were rather serious and not the most original. If you’re looking for some more creative excuses, it should be reflected in your examples:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
Surely this will work on even the most skeptical boss.,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
4. Adjust the parameters,https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,12
"Another way to affect the completion is to adjust some of the model parameters. A useful parameter is the temperature. You can increase creativity by tweaking the temperature. With temperature 0, the model will always choose the most probable completion, so it will always be the same. Increasing the temperature will provide variable completions, where the completion may be different for every generation:",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11
"A task that requires accurate results (such as classification) is best performed with low temperature, whereas a task that requires more creativity should be conducted with high temperature (0.7 is a reasonable starting point).",https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart,11

Self-supervision for Pre-trained Language Models,https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,7
"The use of self-supervision has allowed neural language models to advance the frontier in Natural Language Understanding. Specifically, the self-supervision strategy employed in BERT, which involves masking some of the words in an input sentence and training the model to predict them given their context, results in a versatile language model suited for many tasks. Nevertheless, existing self-supervision methods operate on the word-form level, and as such, they are inherently limited. Take the word ‘bass’ as an example: in one context it can refer to a fish, in a second to a guitar, in the third to a type of singer, and so on. The word itself is merely a surrogate of its actual meaning in a given context - referred to as its sense.",https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,7
Word-Sense predictions made by SenseBERT on a raw input text.,https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,7
"The word ""Bass"" maps to its different supersenses according to context.",https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,7
SenseBERT - Pre-training on Word Senses,https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,7
"We propose a method to employ self-supervision directly at the word sense level. Our model, named SenseBERT, is pre-trained to predict not only the masked words (as in BERT) but also their WordNet supersenses. BERT’s current word-form level objective leads to what is commonly referred to as a language model: the model predicts words for the given masked position in a sentence. Our added task allows SenseBERT to gather word-sense level statistics and thereby we effectively train a semantic-level language model that predicts the missing word’s meaning jointly with the standard word-form level prediction.",https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,7
"Self-supervision allows neural language models to learn from massive amounts of unannotated text. In order to enjoy this advantage at the lexical-semantic level, we make use of WordNet - an expert-constructed ontology that provides an inventory of word senses.

Grounding Language Models In-Context: Improving Text Generation and Attribution for Off-the-Shelf LMs,https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
"Text generation via language models (LMs) is dramatically improving, but LMs do not attribute their generated text to its sources and can often make mistakes. We propose the simple framework of 𝘐𝘯-𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵 𝘙𝘦𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘷𝘢𝘭 𝘈𝘶𝘨𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘓𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘔𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘴, which allows for grounding 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘰𝘧𝘧-𝘵𝘩𝘦-𝘴𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘧 𝘓𝘔 in knowledge from external sources, and attributing the text it generates to its sources.",https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
 ,https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
"Recent advances in language modeling have dramatically increased the usefulness of machine-generated text across a wide range of use-cases and domains. An outstanding Achilles’ heel of LM generated text is that it is not attributed to a specific source, and often includes factual inaccuracies or errors. This problem is present in any LM generation scenario, and is exacerbated when generation is made in uncommon domains, or when it involves up-to-date information that the LM has not seen during training. A promising approach for addressing this challenge is Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM), grounding the LM during generation by conditioning on relevant documents retrieved from an external knowledge source.",https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
"Leading RALM systems introduced in recent years tend to be focused on altering the language model architecture, and the need for changes in architecture and dedicated retraining has hindered the wide adoption of such models. Thus, while the RALM approach bears potential to alleviate factual inaccuracies and to provide direct sources for the generated text, it is in practice not deployed alongside leading LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
"In our paper, we present In-Context RALM: a simple yet powerful RALM method which can be used for endowing any off-the-shelf LM with access to external knowledge sources. In-Context RALM simply inserts the retrieved document to a regular LM’s input, rendering it applicable even for LM behind API . While existing works choose which documents to show the LM via standard general purpose approaches, we propose several novel methods for grounded generation oriented document selection.",https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
 ,https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
"Our simple and easily deployable setup allows improving the language modeling abilities of off-the-shelf LMs to those equivalent to increasing the LM's number of parameters by 4X, across a diverse evaluation set of five text corpora. We believe that further gains can be achieved via developing the generation-oriented retrieval mechanism, while retaining the straightforward document insertion mechanism of RALM.",https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7
"To help others both to deploy and to build upon our work, our paper is accompanied by an online release of all our code, datasets, trained models, and indexes for our standardized suite of corpora.",https://www.ai21.com/news/grounding-language-models-in-context,7

What we did,https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7
"We designed a simple and efficient method, called Auxiliary Tuning, for adapting a pre-trained Language Model (LM) to a novel task, and demonstrated the approach on the task of conditional text generation. Our approach supplements the original pre-trained model with an auxiliary model that shifts the output distribution according to the target task.",https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7
Why it matters,https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7
"Achieving state-of-the-art fluency in language tasks such as text generation entails costly training of large LMs. Auxiliary Tuning allows practitioners to amortize this cost across target tasks by leveraging existing pre-trained LMs. This is done without modifying the pre-trained weights, avoiding the risks of rigidity and catastrophic forgetting, and allowing natural scaling to multiple target tasks.",https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7
How it works,https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7
"The auxiliary model is trained by adding its logits to the pre-trained model logits and maximizing the likelihood of the target task output. Our method imposes no constraints on the auxiliary architecture. In particular, the auxiliary model can ingest additional input relevant to the target task, independently from the pre-trained model’s input. Furthermore, mixing the models at the logits level provides a natural probabilistic interpretation of the method.",https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7
"We tested Auxiliary Tuning on a number of different conditional text generation tasks. Adapting a pre-trained LM using our method resulted in similar performance to training a comparable model on the target task from scratch, while using significantly less compute for training.  Below we present results for a text generation task conditioned on keywords, where the generated text has to include the keyword provided to the model. We show that our method achieves similar accuracy (the fraction of samples that contain the keyword that we conditioned on) compared to a naive autoregressive Transformers baseline. Interestingly, our method generates fluent samples early in training, demonstrating its effectiveness of harnessing the fluency of the pre-trained model (as measured by SLOR).",https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,7

Analyze large quantities of reviews in minutes using AI21 Studio,https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,6
"Imagine that you have a platform for hotel reservations, similar to Hotels.com. On your platform, hotel visitors can leave written reviews and an overall star rating for the hotel. These reviews allow hotel owners to gain a general understanding of guest satisfaction through their overall score, but that’s just one part of the story. The quality of the hotel experience is a combination of many factors, including the room quality, the facilities, and the staff. Ideally, the owner would like to get a clear picture of their hotel’s strengths and weaknesses so they can improve on the aspects that are lacking and highlight the aspects that visitors find positive.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,6
"To extract these insights, some hotel owners sit down from time to time and read all of the reviews that were written about their hotel. This is a tedious task - one you, as a developer, would probably want to spare your users from. What if you could create a dashboard that highlights the areas guests mention positively or negatively in their reviews? As a result, your user - in this case, the hotel owner - can get a real-time snapshot of their strengths and weaknesses with just a glance at this dashboard.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,6
"Not so long ago, you would have needed to work pretty hard to create a solution like that (for example, using several classical methods). But with large language models (LLMs), it’s really easy.

"You want the model to extract the topics and sentiments of each free text review into a structured JSON format. You can do this by leveraging a main strength of language models: when provided with text in plain English, the language model can identify patterns and generate text that follows the same pattern. By feeding the model a prompt with a few examples (this is called a few-shot prompt), it can identify the pattern and generate a reasonably good completion.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,6

What is a MRKL system?,https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,8
"In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,8
"Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,7
"There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,8

This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge.

Performing math operations,https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,8
"A 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.",https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,8

We present a masking strategy that makes bidirectional masked-LM training more educating.,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
In a Nutshell,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"In recent work described by an ICLR 2021 spotlight paper, we show how to replace BERT’s random input masking strategy during pretraining with PMI-Masking, which jointly masks neighboring tokens if they exhibit high correlation over the pretraining corpus. By preventing the model from focusing on shallow local signals, PMI-Masking achieves better representations at a fraction of the training budget. Despite altering only the input masking strategy, PMI-Masking achieves the same BERT pretraining quality in one sixth the time and achieves significantly better pretraining within the same training budget.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7

Masking: BERT’s Added Degree of Freedom,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"Before BERT, neural Language Models (LMs) tended to be autoregressive, learning to predict each input token given preceding text. The Masked Language Model (MLM) training objective of BERT, for which the model learns to predict a masked subset of the input tokens, creates an inherently bidirectional representation of text. But this bidirectionality comes with an added degree of freedom relative to classical autoregressive LMs: choosing which tokens to mask and which to show.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"Our paper highlights that not all bidirectional dependencies are equal: we show that the strategy for choosing which tokens to mask and which to show can profoundly impact an MLM’s performance. Specifically, we show that the standard practice of random uniform masking often allows an MLM to minimize its training objective by latching onto shallow local signals, leading to pretraining inefficiency and suboptimal downstream performance. By limiting the model’s ability to rely on such shortcuts, we obtain the same pretraining performance more quickly and better performance within a fixed training budget.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7

PMI-Masking speed-up and improvement relatively to existing approaches on RACE.,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
A Motivating Example,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"To see the potential harm of local signals, we offer a simple, motivating example of neighboring tokens that are highly correlated with each other: part-of-word tokens that make up the same word. Recall that BERT represents text as a sequence of tokens, where each token is either a word or a part-of-word; e.g., “chair” might constitute a single token while rarer words like “eigenvalue” do not make it into BERT’s vocabulary and are broken up into several part-of-word tokens (“e-igen-val-ue”).",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
 ,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"When using BERT’s regular vocabulary size of 30K tokens, the vast majority of encountered words are represented by single tokens (words are represented via ~1.1 tokens on average). However, when we artificially decrease the vocabulary size to 10K and then to 2K tokens, along the x axis of the following plot, part-of-word tokens become much more common (up to ~2 tokens-per-word on average).",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
 ,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"The blue curve in the above figure shows that when applying BERT’s strategy of choosing 15% of the tokens for masking uniformly at random, the model's performance is severely degraded as part-of-word tokens become prevalent. Thus, by controlling the number of highly correlated tokens, we demonstrate that strong dependencies between neighboring input tokens can harm the model’s ability to learn from broader context. In the presence of such dependencies, the MLM’s objective can often be minimized simply by considering immediate neighbors of the masked token (consider the easy task “e-igen-[mask]-ue”).",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"The red curve in the above figure shows that the degradation is substantially attenuated when local cues are occluded. This is done by applying whole word masking, a popular masking strategy which jointly occludes all part-of-word tokens comprising a word. Our PMI-Masking strategy, presented below, extends this solution to a much more prevalent class of highly correlated tokens: correlated word n-grams.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
Correlated Word N-Grams,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"The above example of part-of-word tokens illustrated a flaw in BERT’s vanilla random masking approach, and the same issue occurs for correlated word n-grams, a class of correlated tokens that is harder to identify but affects any word level vocabulary. Examples include phrases and multi-word expressions such as “editor in chief”, “at once”, “carbon footprint”, and so on. More broadly, many words provide a hint regarding the identity of their neighbors, and such shallow cues can be used by the model to minimize its objective while putting less emphasis on broader context.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"Previous work has proposed masking strategies that can mitigate the effect of such local cues. Notably, Sun et al. (2019) proposed Knowledge Masking, which jointly masks tokens comprising entities and phrases, as identified by external parsers. The restriction to specific types of correlated n-grams, along with the reliance on imperfect tools for their identification, has limited the gains of this approach. With a similar motivation in mind, SpanBERT of Joshi et al. (2020) introduced Random-Span Masking, which masks word spans of lengths sampled from a geometric distribution at random positions in the text. Random-Span Masking was shown to consistently outperform Knowledge Masking, however, with high probability the selected spans break up correlated n-grams, such that the prediction task can often be performed by relying on local cues.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"We offer a principled approach to masking spans that consistently provide high signal, unifying the intuitions behind the above approaches while also outperforming them. In order to identify highly correlated word n-grams, we rely on the measure of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), which quantifies how surprising a bigram w1w2 is, given the unigram probabilities of w1 and w2 in the corpus. Formally, given two tokens w1 and w2, the PMI of the bigram w1w2 is:",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7

Where the probability of an n-gram p(w1... wn) is computed by the number of its occurrences in the corpus divided by the number of all n-grams in the corpus.,https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"PMI is a good indicator of correlation between words comprising a bigram, but extending it to measure correlation between words comprising longer n-grams is nontrivial. We propose the following extension of PMI to longer n-grams, and show that it provides a better signal than existing alternatives:",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"where seg(w1... wn) is the set of all contiguous segmentations of the n-gram w1... wn (excluding the identity segmentation), and where any segmentation σ ∈ seg(w1... wn) is composed of sub-spans that together give w1... wn.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"Intuitively, this measure discards the contribution of high PMI subsegments of the considered n-gram; the minimum in the equation above implies that an n-gram's score is given by its weakest link, i.e., by the segmentation that comes closest to separability. This way, trigrams such as “Kuala Lumpur is” are deranked, since despite the bigram “Kuala Lumpur” having high PMI it is not highly correlated with the word “is”, whereas “editor in chief”, which cannot be broken to uncorrelated subsegments, is promoted for joint masking.",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"By jointly masking n-grams with high PMIn scores, we speed up and improve BERT’s pretraining. When training models with either BERT’s vanilla random-token masking, SpanBERT’s random-span masking or PMI-Masking, in BERT’s original training setup (see details in paper), we get the following 1 to 2 point advantage in prominent benchmarks:",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
"When comparing to prominent released models of the same size (see table at the top of this post), we see that:",https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,7
